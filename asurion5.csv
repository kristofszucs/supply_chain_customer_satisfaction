"Phone ruined, pictures lost, headache to deal with this company",A.T.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-31T00:38:48.000Z,,"My phone had a cracked screen. A technician came to fix it. He lost track of a screw and ended up damaging the battery. All the pictures and videos on the phone were lost forever. The technician took full blame for the accident and told me Asurion would be replacing the phone for free. He gave me a number to call and I called it. The first agent I talked to reassured me the phone would be paid for and to email in the appropriate documents. I did just that. I got a call to verify shipping. I was told I owed $200 for a new phone. I spoke with 4 or 5 different people who did not communicate with each other and I kept being told I had to pay $200 and send the old phone back (which I did not have). I finally got someone to understand what happened and they verified my shipping address and finally sent me a replacement phone for free. But they sent it to the wrong address. Not only did I get my phone ruined and lost all the memories with it, I had to deal with all these frustrations due to poor communication between the technician and each customer service agent. Needless to say, I cancelled my Asurion plan and will no longer be using their service. Apple Care is way better and cheaper anyway."

I got some resistance from the agent because he said that he can't promise I'll get a new one! And i told him, i had to pay a deductible to asurion of $149.00!! I did receive a new one. Then Verizon wasn't accepting the new phone in it's system. I called asurion help again and a kind woman apologized and sent me another one! Same thing happened. Then i called again, got a wonderful woman named Jennifer and she finally fixed the issue with Verizon!! I wish i got her the first time."

10 Days to Even Get My Claim Approved -- Extremely Dissatisfied,Brandi Fox,,US,1 review,2018-05-28T20:25:09.000Z,,Took !!! 10 DAYS !!! start to mailing package. I have already begun speaking with the Better Business Bureau about my experience with Asurion. I have used them in the past with minimal frustration - However this go around was a complete miss on behalf of Asurion. My claim was denied 3x when told over the phone it had been approved. It took 10 days to finally get it approved. I spoke with their customer satisfaction team and was spoken over and read excuses for why my claim went the way it did after telling me my claim was not treated with care - I wanted someone to listen and to record my complaints not to read me excuses. I will not use again and I am extremely upset with my experience. To heck with ASURION

The customer service agent was extremely attentive walking me through every step and handling the activation process, repeatedly expressing their apologies for my missing phone.

However, i was met with a very time consuming road block in the first few minutes of trying to activate the new phone. It wanted me to put in an authorization code that could only be sent to that phone or an authorized phone. The phone I was replacing was broken, therefore I COULDN'T receive the code, and I didn't realize if I had an ""authorized"" phone on my account that would have solved to problem.  I tried calling Asurion for help, but was put on hold for about 20 minutes. I then called Apple for help, finally after about 2 hours of working through a very confusing process we finally achieved success."

WORST SERVICE EVER!,Daron Knox,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-24T19:37:53.000Z,,This was probally one of the most upsetting experiences that i have ever had. I spent $250 dollars thinking that i would recieved a phone that was already actvated. When i got the phone it would not connect to the network so i called sprint. I sat on the phone with sprint for an hour only to be told that i was sent a phone that was associated with another phone number and told that i needed to contact asurion. At this point i was furious! I called asurion and talked with their representative where i was informed that there was nothng they could do until the next day becuase the office that handles the matter was closed. I called the next day when i got to work. The called took about 40 mintues of my morning in which i was told in needed to submitted my ID and additional paperwork in which the already had. At that point the repersentative called the claims adjuster who verified they had the documents need to process my claim. Then the line went blank. I have to call asurion 4 different times back to back to get the issue solved. It's currently four days later and i still have no working phone. I was told that the claim had been processed manually and there is no tracking number which means at day 4 it has not yet been shipped. Also i was given a range of 1-3 days before i would gwt the device. This is by far the worst costumer service i have ever recieved but whats even worse than that is that I'm sure no one will have to answer for this mess up. How do we aviod this happening to other costumers? If there was another insuance company i would certainly drop them.

Don’t waste your time or money!!,Lindy Speake,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-24T08:54:54.000Z,,Had to pay an outrageous deductible only to be sent a defective device. After calling only 7 days after receiving my device I was told I would have to pay yet another outrageous deductible. The entire process was a hassle! I emailed corporate and received an email back (not just one email from corporate but 2) telling me to call and they would handle the issue only to spend another 30 minutes on the phone and get absolutely nothing accomplished! Unfortunately my experience with Asurion was very adverse and I would not recommend the company to anyone! It’s a total waste of money paying $35 a month for total mobile protection plus an outrageous deductible only to receive a defective “refurbished” device.

Customer NO service,Colin Irwin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,4 reviews,2018-05-22T16:02:10.000Z,,After our washing machine broke down we contacted Asurion for service through our extended warranty policy. Now six weeks later and multiple visits our washer is still not repaired. When I requested a different service company Asurion told me to go find one myself. This has been an extremely frustrating experience and now we purchased a new washer rather than wait even longer for repairs that may never happen. Save yourself the aggravation and do not buy this useless warranty.

I had to reset the 4 digit passcode online and wait a few hours. By this time it was late in the day and I was worried the phone wouldn’t ship that day, but it did!

The experience with Asurion was fine,DAVID H,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-16T12:20:25.000Z,,"The experience with Asurion was fine. The employees were curtious and helpful in replacing the phone. I received a refurbished phone a model newer. It was easy to transfer my apps and pictures. They were not helpful in finding a place to repair the phone. They just wanted me to provide a zip code. That was the only way they could check.My only complaint was that although the cracked screen repair for $29.00 was an option on my policy, I still had to spend $150.00 to replace my phone, because there were no repair places anywhere close to my home that I could discover. I had to keep searching by zip code trying to find a place. I spent a lot of time searching. It would have been better if the company could have a list of repair companies available, or if employees could have a list by state. I would have been willing to send the phone to a place relatively close.There are repair places in my town, but not on the Asurion list."

Horrible service,Uly Carvalho,,US,2 reviews,2018-05-15T16:02:01.000Z,,"Horrible service. They made me want to cancel my contract with Sprint all together. I got my phone stolen on May 8th today is the 15th and it's suppose to be next day delivery with insurance, but the phone is on back order. They never tell you that the phone you receive is not only refurbished, but also they don't guarantee the same color. They told me it would take 3-5 business days when in backorder, however after going on the website it showed 7-14 days. I spoke to a representative and she said it could take longer than 14 days, it all depends when they get in ""new"" phones. Another day I called back and had someone tell me they had gotten in new phones two days prior to me calling. However it still showed backorder on the website. Not to mention when I asked if it's always like this the lady laughed and said ""Oh I don't know what happened, it's probably because it's spring break"".Everyone I spoke to gave me different information that was not helpful and I still haven't received my phone. My advice is if you're thinking about if insurance is worth it, not with Asurion."

So no one contacted me letting me know it was out of stock.  Instead they sent me a little cheesy phone costing way less value..  Instead of treating me fair they were rude and UNPROFESSIONAL...  BEEN ALMOST FOUR DAYS AND STILL NO PHONE HAD TO CALL TO TRACK MY PACKAGE WHICH MY EMAIL SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A NOTIFICATION.. No one would give me cooperate number to resolve the issue .
When I received my replacement phone,Justina,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-14T14:33:20.000Z,,"When I received my replacement phone, Asurion sent me a T-Mobile iPhone and an At&t SIM card! When we went into the At&t store and they informed us of this, they assured us Asurion would probably send an overnight phone to me and take care of it. When I got home I gave Asurion a call and was connected with an unpleasant representative. When I asked how long until we received our second replacement iPhone she said in a few days (it was a Monday night) and I had asked if it could be overnight. She said we don't do that! Then she told me I need to send back one of the iphones immediately back to them (the broken one and the T-Mobile one)!  I was feeling blamed for their mistake and never was apologized to. It was apparently my problem I had two iphones. I found this whole situation careless and unpleasant!"

And although postage is paid and the phones come within a day or 2, the hassle of switching phones over and over and over and over again has been absolutely ridiculous, frustrating and irritating.

I was lied to through Verizon numerous times about having three phones per year.... It's actually three phones after your last claim you have to wait 12 months... So you will be uninsured for an entire year. Once you're in this insurance company you can't switch over to another Insurance Company. Also if you upgrade your phone you cannot go through Asurion if you've already made your claims and you only get 3. They don't go by upgrades they go by telephone number. This entire experience has been a huge headache and I no longer want to do business with them after my insurance is up.

I held on to the insurance too long for maximum benefit.

Simple repair became royal pain,STEPHEN W,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-11T01:01:34.000Z,,"I needed to repair the screen on my current cellphone so I could trade it in for a brand new phone. The equipment Asurion sent the tech with was faulty and the only way to replace the screen was to destroy the old one. After the tech was finished, my phone was less functional than before and could still not be traded in. Upon calling Asurion to report the failed repair I was informed they could not send anyone else out to fix it BUT I could pay a small fee of $120 to replace the whole phone. I had previously paid $30 for a failed screen replacement and did not feel like wasting any additional money on this company's subpar service. It took an hour of phone time (calling from someone else's phone because mine was unusable) to finally get a reasonable resolution to the problem, one that didn't cost me a ton more money to resolve a problem their lousy equipment made worse. I should say that the tech was efficient and polite and the company (and their policies and their fees and their telephone customer service) are pretty pathetic. I am deeply saddened that should my current phone be damaged I will have to deal with them again."

Im still waiting and this was said on Tuesday.I've been charged  £100 excess and £14.99 a month for nearly 2 years to recieve a phone that doesnt work and lied to as they said they would remove this blacklisting and send me an email of proof of exchange.

Refurbished phone,CHRISTINA A,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-05-02T14:06:46.000Z,,I receive my new refurbished phone in a timely manner and it was efficient. Set up had a few issues but every issue was over come.  I am a little frustrated that my new phone already has a crack and I have not dropped it or hit it against anything.  It started near the face button on the bottom and I think it was something the phone had an issue with when I got it. I know no one would believe me so I haven't called about it but I'm not careless and use my phone for work therefore I believe the phone i received was not a quality product.

She made appointments with me, called me at the exact specified times, and was a delight to work with.  She also helped me get the ""find my phone"" feature turned off on my damaged phone.   My 5 star experience is totally attributed to Cindy!!"

I'd give them no stars if I could,Nikole Wilson-Ripsom,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-04-27T18:56:34.000Z,,"I'd give them no stars if I could.  On 4/22 I filed an online claim on my phone.  After receiving no further information, on 4/23 I called and was told my claim had been denied because my phone was ""malfunctioning"" and not ""broken.""  When the agent asked for a description, I mentioned a crack in my screen and he indicated, ""The crack is likely the cause of your touch screen no longer working.  Screen cracks can cause other, more significant phone problems.""  So, I scheduled a repair for the soonest date, 4/27.   At 9:10 am on 4/27, I received an email from a colleague of mine in another building on campus telling me that the repair technician was there and asking what building I was in.  I told her and she gave him directions - get back on the ONLY road and go straight towards the clock tower.  You'll drive around a big grassy oval and the mansion that is on the oval, that's the building.""  It's two buildings over from her - a 5 minute walk.  A 10 minute drive if you have trouble parking - or, if you drove straight in the wrong direction, in which case, you would have to make a right turn and then another right in order to head toward the clock tower and grassy oval.  I went downstairs and stood in front of my building - for the next 40 minutes.  It's a one-way road, with a 5 mph speed limit.  He did not drive past me.  The campus is under video surveillance, so I actually have video proof that he did not drive past the building, which, if he had followed the directions he was given, he would have been forced to do (due to the one way streets on campus.)  After 40 minutes, I came to my office and contacted Asurion who told me that the technician couldn't locate me and couldn't get me on my phone (because it's broken!)  They said that no one could come back today, but someone could come tomorrow.  I explained that this is my job, I won't be here on the weekend, but I would be taking an elderly family member to dialysis, doing their banking, shopping, taking my son to soccer, etc. - in other words, I won't be at a location for any 3 hour window tomorrow.  They then said I could get a replacement phone, for an additional $60 above what I'd already paid for a repair visit that didn't happen.  I refused, demanding either a same day repair visit or a replacement for the cost of the non-visit.  They refused.  After a bit more discussion about the status of my phone, the service agent said, ""If your phone is not working, the tech couldn't repair the screen anyway.""  THIS IS LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE FIRST SERVICE REP SAID ON TUESDAY.  The one who encouraged me to get the screen repaired so that the phone would start to work again."

"Great service with Assurion, not so much with SquareTrade.....",CLAYTON G,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-26T23:31:04.000Z,,"I had moved to square trade on all the newer phones in the family because it was cheaper.  But this last phone was still insurred by Assurion.  When it broke it was really easy to fix.  Practically no down time and the phone showed up the next day.  Excellent service.  My experience with the newly purchased SquareTrade was nowhere near as good.  Had to take it to a shop, they did not have the parts, waited for the parts, left the phone there for several hours, picked it up fixed but the bill was $350.  That came out of my pocket until thier reimbursement came through for the deference between that and my deductable.  SquareTrade is not a deal at all."

When I called to file the claim I stated that the issue was that my phone screen was cracked.  I was then directed to complete the process to replace the phone.  When the new phone arrived, in the process of chsnging phones, I open a box a 2 screen protectors.  I found them to be hard plastic.  I stopped & rexamined my old phone. I noted that I had a similar screen on it.  I then removed it to discover the cracks on my phone were to the protective screen & not the phone screen.  I then called & made arrangements to return the new ohone. In this process I learned that my situation is not uncommon.  I would therefore suggest that when someone calls in a claim related to a cracked screen that they be asked if they have a protective screen on their phone & if so have they removed it to see if the cracks weee to the protective screen rather than the phone."

0 comments,Shelby Crotty,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-23T05:58:06.000Z,,0 commentsI started this process Jan 10th.Received a phone last week of March.They told me to change the dates as my account holder on the phone was out of the country. Then they tried to deny the claim cause the dates didn’t match. Which they gave the dates. Then send out a phone that wouldn’t charge.THEN replace that one with a phone with the screen burnt out and can’t even use cause it was so hot after charging it i couldn’t touch it. Here we are Mid April i just now have a working phone and they have 112$. Side note they finally sent me a brand new device an iPhone 7s plus which i had a 6s plus. They did me no favor lol.They had no more 6s plus phones that weren’t refurbished and my locate att demanded they send me a brand new phone.I will be cancelling my ins and tell everyone never to deal with this company!Horrible customer arrive and horrible products!Minus the last girl i spoke with who kept going until she got the job done!!I wasted a total of 6 hours on the phone with this company.

I had an appointment set up for six days after the day I first contacted Asurion (the first available appointment). The technician never showed or called.  When I called Asurion they said the appointment had been canceled because the repair items were not available,  but they never informed me of this. I then had to replace the phone and have it shipped overnight, my only other option. I did receive it the next day and they waived the usual fee because of their screw up, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place. I didn't want a refurbished phone, mine was only a couple of months old. The phone works fine, no problems so far."

Insurance is a joke.,TRIN,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-22T15:37:07.000Z,,"It's ridiculous paying for insurance every month and then you have to pay OVER $200 on a new phone, only to have to send the old one back instead of keeping it. Seriously about the dumbest thing ever. I'll be sure to cancel both devices insurance and just buy a new phone until I feel like upgrading. Phone insurance is a JOKE. The only nice thing was it took 2 days to get to me, but I still got a junk refurbished phone that I paid $225 for! Still not happy."

Horrible Experience,Michael Eastep,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-04-20T16:59:53.000Z,,"Horrible experience.  In short, it was 4 weeks of no-shows/no-calls, not ordering the part until a week after the initial no-show appointment, promises of part availability, later claims of that same part being unavailable, more no-shows/no-calls, call transfers, and on and on. Tried to upsell me to the replacement (higher deductible) for a simple fix every time, but miraculously found the part when fraud is mentioned.  This is a scam to upsell you and drag out your subscription, pure and simple.  Would've been far cheaper to purchase the kit myself than to carry insurance and deal with this.  The silver lining is that I never have to deal with them again."
Maybe I'm 1 in a million,John Friesen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-20T16:36:43.000Z,,"My wife’s iPhone died in January of 2017.  She used her Asurion warranty and few days later a “new” phone appeared.   Great – expect that the quality of the refurbished phone was not up to par and didn’t quite work correctly.   Dropped calls, blacked out screen, calls straight to voicemail, the phone was obviously a lemon.   So onto phone #2 in February – this one worked a little better, it lasted until December of 2017.   Call it 10 months, then it starts to hit the skids.  Quits working.   Get another phone through Asurion while paying an additional “deductible” plus monthly fees.    This phone lasts from December 2017 to April of 2018 and then promptly dies.    I take the phone into a local repair shop who informs me the motherboard is defective.   Call the company, and the representative (who was nice by the way) informs us the warranty is for 1 year before talking to a boss and learning the warranty has been moved down to 90 days.   Great move by a management – why give a warranty on something that in my experience works properly for more than 1 year exactly 0% of the time. At this point, we give up and buy a new iPhone.   I would have been better off buying a new iPhone, getting a manufacturer’s warranty, then paying monthly for this insurance option plus having to pay deductibles.   In my experience the refurbished phones that Asurion provides of extremely low quality and are unlikely to last more than 6 months.   While Apple is providing the funds to Asurion, there has to be some sort of quality control program in place to ensure they are replacing customer’s phones with suitable replacements, but in my experience they are not.  Maybe I am one in million with my experience, but I doubt it.   I believe Asurion knows they are sending out poor quality replacement phones that they are acquiring a lower cost than what actual replacement phones should cost."

In my particular case, the screen was destroyed so I was not able to access the functions of the phone to send a message but the phone itself was capable of sending a message.  A call to the customer service number was needed to clarify to avoid potential issues.  Other than that, the process was very smooth and easy."

I received my fist replacement and it…,Corey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CA,1 review,2018-04-13T14:21:33.000Z,,"I received my fist replacement and it was a locked for another carrier (sasktel phone for a telus customer). Spent many hours on the phone and they wouldn't do anything for me until I printed their paperwork and signed it and sent it back to them and gave them my credit card again.  Second replacement arrived and was another locked phone for a different carrier and again went through hell and didn't get anywhere.  At this point I have two unusable phones sent to me and getting terrible customer service.  So after being screwed around finally I got a call and the girl said "" we will send you a cheque for the purchase amount of the phone on the Telus website"".  So I went on the telus website and found it and the price was $904 plus tax.  I agreed to take the offer and then I received a cheque for a lesser amount.  I thought it was a mistake so I contacted them again (at this point I'm after sending them my damaged phone and the 2 unusable replacement phones).  They ask me to email them the link to the telus website where the phone and price was listed so I did.  They said that the device is currently not available for purchase so we gave you the price of simular phone that was available which is listed for less.  I said that I didn't agree to those terms and they didn't care and said that that's all I was going to get.  This battle isn't over yet. They made me feel like I was a liar so I told them to listen to their recorded phone call to confirm that the agreement that I said was actually true. My advice to everyone would be to find a different company for coverage of you need it.  Unfortunately the lowest rating I can give is one star,  there should be negative star ratings for companies like this."

If I could give them a 0 I would,Carmen ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-12T21:09:49.000Z,,If I could give them a 0 I would. I had to reschedule 3 times. I don’t know if it’s that they don’t communicate with each other or what but I would get confirmation text and email for my screen repair. Then at the time of the appointment they would call and cancel due to either not having the parts or having car issue ( i understand car issue ) but at the end of the every si for time I was stood up and mind you I would be home waiting and had to change my schedule around for them never to show up. When i would  call to get help they would hang up on me. I’ve totally hated this. Literally the worst

Good luck getting a repair.,Leah Penza,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,4 reviews,2018-04-12T18:01:39.000Z,,"If you want a replacement, no problem.. If you want a repair, good luck!  I cracked my screen on a 5 month old phone, and cannot get it fixed.  My repair deductible just went down to $49, but there is no way to do that.  I checked my zip code, and I am apparently not in the eligible area.  I checked all the zip codes within 50 miles of me, with no luck.  I checked a city that I am going to next week, no luck.  Curiously, I checked zip codes all throughout NEW YORK CITY and they can't even repair it in the most populated city in the country.  THIS HAS TO BE A SCAM RIGHT?!? I am absolutely furious that I pay for this service every month, am advertised that my deductible went down, and then realize that they cannot even do what they say they can do.  So instead of the $49 that I am advertised to fix my perfectly good working phone, I am forced to get a replacement for $225.  That is just not right..."

They treat you poorly on the phone, keep transferring you from one operator to another and disconnect you in the process.

Thanks for the response below that does nothing to fix the situation. Asurion is awful! Don’t use this company!I jumped through hoop after hoop only to be sent a refurbished phone which doesn't work properly. What a crock! They are rude and inefficient and are the reason I'm leaving Verizon!"
I am not even sure what to title this…,K,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-04-09T02:44:35.000Z,,"I am not even sure what to title this email. Maybe call it “frustrated”, or “does anyone really care”, or even “you win, I give up.” No matter what I title the email, the facts of my complaint still stand. I hope you will take a moment to read this email and by the time you reach the end, I hope you are shaking your head in disbelief and understand my level of frustration with the services AT&T and Asurion have provided.Providing a slight background, my family switched to AT&T recently after 20 years or more with Verizon. We switched in hopes of better service, more features and better overall value. We especially like the insurance package offered by AT&T through Asurion. We signed on and insured 4 cells phones and two devices to be named later. All was well I thought… Unfortunately, my first and only claim has turned into a nightmare. When my contracts are up, I will be forced to seek another carrier based solely on Asurion’s poor customer service, lies, false promises and unresponsiveness… I will be spending some of my days posting how poor an Insurance provider Asurion is and how AT&T got me to them. So the story starts off several months ago when my German Shepard puppy decided to see how the outside of my Ipad Mini 2 tasted and proceed to crack the screen in a few places. I then figured out that the Ipad would be one of two unnamed devices associated with my phone insurance policy provided by Asurion. I completed the forms and received a box to ship my Ipad off to Asurion in hopes and quick repairs and a fully functioning Ipad. After days after shipping my Ipad to Asurion, I got it back with a new screen and s couple of cosmetic teeth marks still in the back of the Ipad. I quickly went to turn on my Ipad and soon discovered that the home button was not working correctly…After a week or two, I contacted Asurion through the on-line chat feature. I chatted with one of Asurion’s representatives who offered to send me a replacement Ipad. I questioned the replacement of the Ipad but was assured that Asurion would send me a new one and all I had to do was return the old one (with the malfunctioning home button) to Asurion within 10 days. I said great, lets do it and the representative ended our conversation with a promised new Ipad being delivered to my residence. A day or two later, I received a box in the mail that seemed awfully light. I opened the box to discover that it was simply a box to return my Ipad to Asurion for the second time. A little baffled, I reviewed the chat conversation between Asurion and I and was puzzled that I had not received a new Ipad. I contacted Asurion, a was told that the representative should not have said that and that they would not stand behind their promise of replacing the Ipad. I escalated the call and was told the same thing, basically we know what we said, and we know you have it in writing, but Asurion is not going to honor their commitment to replace the Ipad you will simply have to ship it back. For my troubles, they provided a small gift card, not a refund or an amount to cover the deductible that AT&T quickly charged me for. The Ipad was once again shipped back to Asurion.I received notification that Asurion had received my Ipad, fixed it and returned it to me all in the same day. Somewhat impress, I looked forward to getting my Ipad back all repaired, even against the promises that were made in writing by Asurion. When I got my Ipad back I was shocked. The Ipad still had a malfunctioning home button but now I was able to see the inner workings of the Ipad because the screen was not attached properly. I then called Asurion’s customer service line. My level of frustration only continued to grow as I was put on hold, transferred, put on hold and then told no supervisor would take a call from me. I was simply told I would have to send the Ipad back for a THIRD time. I did get the obligatory and with not heart felt sentiment “I am sorry” from your customer service person, but really, they aren’t sorry and they did very little to resolve my frustration. I would now be required to return to the UPS store for the third time and after more than six weeks, I still didn’t have a fully functioning Ipad. I posted an on-line review of my experiences with Asurion and received an email back asking for my information so that a representative from Asurion could reach out to me to try and resolve the issue. I provided my contact information several times and eventually (about 4 or five days later). Someone finally called me, left a voice and provided no information to contact them back at. This happened another time with the same information. I finally received a call from Stephen Ward with Asurion, on March 23rd, the same day I shipped my Ipad back for the THIRD time. I even stuck the repair order physically inside of my Ipad so they could see the screen was not attached. Stephen made promises that he would make this situation right and would do everything in his power to resolve my frustrations. Stephen asked for a day or two to speak with others about what had occurred. When I had not heard from him for several more day I contacted him and left a series of voicemails. Mr. Ward finally returned the call stating that he was still working on it, but again assured me he would make it right. This was nearing the end of the next week and I still did not have my Ipad or any answers. The following week I reached out to Stephen by email and voicemail and still had no answers from him. He did not return emails and often I had to leave 2 or 3 voicemails before he would call me back. Stephen was not fixing the situation, he was simply making it worse. Finally, I spoke with Stephen, who still had no definitive answers and I set a deadline for him to provide an answer before I would file more complaints about Asurion and AT&T. Stephen called me back the same day and offered me a settlement (payout) for my Ipad. Instead of fighting this anymore, I agreed to the settlement offer. That was more than a week ago. In this time, I have repeatedly asked Stephen for a confirmation email or a tracking number as he said the check would be sent immediately using Fedex. I have continued to ask for this information by both email and voicemail. I have yet to receive a response from Asurion. I am reaching out to you for help. I am frustrated, angry, disappointed, lied to, and have been disrespected by Asurion and their employees / representative. I need a course of action on how to best resolve this issue so that I can either be compensated for the Ipad, or I get an Ipad back from Asurion that works and is functionally intact. I am starting to think that neither is ever going to occur. It is my hopes and desires that someone with Asurion or AT&T will reach out to me and provide me with a credible and honest solution to this. I still have no Ipad, no compensation for the Ipad and no hope that anyone with Asurion really even cares."

I didn't even wait 1 day from the time I reported my claim to the time the replacement device arrived. Instructions provided were very clear. I wish, however, that you had recommended the Smart Switch app from Samsung to move over all the apps on the phone so that I didn't lose all my apps and have redownload them all, one by one.  But that's really minor.  Aside from that, very easy!"

Paid insurance on phone for 2yrs. Only to have to fight with Asurian for a total of four days. To get the correct phone. Wasn't like I was asking for a newer model or something.

After calming down I called back to give a second chance to this company only to basically be told there was nothing they could do to help me out. I can't believe that AT&T puts there name on anything to do with this company

I was told I would recieve my phone the following day, so I just thought, ""maybe I am supposed to pay for it after I recieve my phone or it'll be charged to my phone bill.""  So I gave up, then I did not get my phone the next day and ended up having to wait the weekend before I recieved it on Monday.  I wish I would have been told that I HAD to pay for the phone before it would be shipped, that way I could have gotten it the following day (a Friday) instead of having to wait until Monday.

This is my third complaint, but my efforts aren't appreciated or helped.Asurion, I hope you appreciate my feedback. I hope you are very sorry to hear that my experience with you has been less than satisfactory as you strive to provide a helpful and professional interaction on each and every call you receive. You would seem to appreciate the opportunity to rectify any questions or concerns I have regarding my situation. I constantly feel free to contact you anytime but it's pretty pointless."

The reason I say that is because I was asked ""was there any accessories""  that I had with my phone,  I told him yes and all it was was a screen protector that I paid a good chunk of change for. The gentleman responded back with ok what about earbuds? I told him yes and he said, we will make sure those get in with your device and as far as the screen protector, it comes with a factory one. Well I said awesome that's great I appreciate it thank him for his service and commended him on how polite and respectful he was. I got my phone in the mail and there was no screen protector no we're buds the only thing that was in there that they said would be in there was my phone. If the gentleman wouldn't have said it comes with a factory one or we will make sure it gets in with your device I would give it a higher rating and I wouldn't be as upset."

Reasonable coverage.,GARY T,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-04-03T15:40:25.000Z,,"Once I got through the issues of filing (with aid of an rep) it all went smooth. Records/specs of the insured device needing replacing which they   had was incorrect. So I did not proceed to proceed a claim alone till the discrepancy was fixed.  And though they offered a similar replacement device, it was not to a more current  generation level I would have expected. I say that due to cost of the original and amount of insurance premium paid over 30 months. I must admit that once all prosper documents were completed, the processing including receipt of replacement was Top Notch."

Asurion just turned it off. Literally just turned it off and says they want the phone back, it would have been nice to know before the time and money was spent getting my old one. How about you let your representatives know they should actually try to help their customers. DONT USE ASURION."

Made the claim back in January, the last week I have been really on top of getting asutrion to do something. So finally today I get the email to pay for the deductible and they are trying to send me a Samsung s8 plus. ON ALL OF THE PAPER WORK, THE IMEI NUMBER, EVERYTHING IS A SAMSUNG S8! So we called them back for them to tell us it would be a huge deal if we sent them the s8 and not a plus. Asurion then puts us on hold for about half an hour and they come back to say the s8 is on back order! They have been doing nothing but pushing my claim back and have done nothing to help me in any way. I only had the phone for a few weeks before it was broke and it’s now been about 5 months since we started the claim."

I was asked to download, complete and fax a form,  but unfortunately had trouble downloading the form on my phone at the time and didn’t own a computer. Of course, if I don’t own a computer I don’t own a fax machine. I had to go out of my way to rush and find somewhere to get this taken care before 5pm in order to get a new device sent overnight. Once I received my device, things were okay. Unfortunately, the new device doesn’t work as well as the original store bought device. This device freezes all too often and does not work on speaker phone. I am not sure whether this is something that can be fixed because I don’t want to order another device due to the hassle."

Three times just to process,Peter Greaves,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-03-30T15:51:35.000Z,,"Had to go through the claims process 3 times.The first time it hung, the second time it went through everything then said the phone model was not in service on the line on the time. The third time it went through everything (20 minutes) then demanded I download a form (which I have never had to do), fill it out essentially swearing I was not a liar and make a copy of it and my drivers license, and then scan them and send them to them. They then said I would have an answer in 2 hours, I got it 16 hours later. The overall feel now is that they treat everyone like a liar, try to make the process as slow as possible to discourage you from applying, reject every claim the first time, and are adding more and more difficult steps to the process. Let me add I realize they have probably had a number of fraudulent or problematic claims, but making things harder for people with legitimate claims and making you feel like you are being accused of cheating will slowly erode the business model. 3 years ago I could have processed the same claim in less than 5 minutes. Discouraging fake claims is understandable, but making the process so onerous that long-time customers are cancelling is just dumb.I have had 4 lines covered by Asurions for year, I will be cancelling all 4. As a long time customer my recommendation is do not bother with their coverage, it is not worth what you pay or the hassle of doing a claim."

He had his first one replaced without any problems. The second one had display issues and eventually quit working after dropping it. I don't know if it was because it was a refurbished phone or not. The deductible is a hard one for us to swallow, since we are a one income couple, but it's still better than having to come up with $700 for a new one. The return process was quick and they were very courteous. We had the new phone by 10am the next morning. Awesome company!!"

However, the biggest problem was that the phone needed to be sent to my son in another city. Due to policy Asurion would not allow me to supply a shipping address directly to him or even to a Fed Ex Store for them to hold it for pick up by my son. They shipped it to me and I got it overnight, but then had to incur a further cost  and shipping delay to turn around and ship it to my son. It would be great if that could be changed for the convenience of the customer."

Super helpful customer service and very efficient in handling problems.  After I lost my phone, I filled out my claim and within 24 hours my replacement phone had been shipped - unfortunately the FedEx people left it on my doorstep and someone stole the package.  So I had to report the stolen package and the sent another replacement right away and blacklisted the first replacement.   I am so happy I took out the insurance and recommend that all persons consider this a MUST when getting a phone and specifically with Asurion.  Kudos to a great customer service team as well.

Would suggest in future that there can be a reasonable attempt to clarify with me (or anyone in a similar situation) before rejection. After having to call both Asurion to figure out what was going on and then ATT to verify I did in fact have insurance coverage over my device, and THEN having to completely file a new claim several days more of my time were wasted. Over a letter that reasonably could be considered a typo. HOWEVER, after refiling my claim a second time everything went smoothly, and representatives I spoke with throughout both experiences were pleasant and helpful."

We were about to return one of his phones again (yes, he's not very responsible), but when I talked with the Verizon guy he said the deductible was $150 !!!!  The Asurion web site says $29 for screen repair and $89 for replacement.  Nothing (not even a disclaimer in small print) says anything about a deductible other than those two.  When the Verizon guy called them on it, the Asurion rep just reiterated the $150 deductible and made no attempt to honor the price on their web site.

Review of my Asurion experience,PHYLLIS K,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-03-20T02:03:35.000Z,,"I would have rated Asurion 5 stars, but I was disappointed that I had to pay $140 deductible to get a replacement phone (Samsung S5), that I could have purchased on Ebay or Amazon for around $75.  I paid monthly premiums of $12-$13 for 2 years, which totaled around $280 or so.  It was not worth having the insurance for this phone.  Therefore, I will cancel my policy until some time I purchase a brand new, later version phone."

manipulative and misleading!,Joseph Gergis,,CA,2 reviews,2018-03-19T19:15:42.000Z,,"I phoned regarding my screen broken Iphone 6 s plus and they said we do not have it and offered reimbursed. Off course none can live without phone so I went and looked around for a plan and phone, by the time I arranged a plan and phone , I phoned back and here is the surprise that no it is now available in stock and we can not reimburse!!! What I am supposed to do with my current phone and plan? none answered, what am supposed to do with the extra phone you will send? None answered. Then they say Oh in the terms you should pay the fees to lock your claim, then why I was not told that in the phone call? Nope because it is in the terms!! Very misleading and manipulative. DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY."

We use this phone in pur business. They were not concerned at all they basically are accusing use of not being who were are even tho we use pass word and call on another phone if your phone is important to you please don't buy and rely on this company. I would just put that mu h money in savings account each month. And just buy another phone when it gets broke or goes bad. These are genuine 100% crooks please don't support this type of abuse in our country. Can you imagine how they must treat our elderly people. I would have to assume they rip them of daily. Sad when America allowed this to happen. If you have att phone for business you might want to reconsider they could care less about you or your ability to communicate with your customer. Also when you try to talk they try and over talk you so you will get upset and say sometime so they can disconnect call with out dealing with problem or customer.worst company I have interaction with in a long time.

I used the service twice, once in Florida and again in New York. The Florida experience was top-notch with a repairman coming to me to replace a cracked LCD. Unfortunately, a month later I need to do it again only this time in New York. Lo and behold, I was told that the cracked LCD cannot be replaced and that I needed to spend $150 on a replacement phone. Oh, and they didn't have any replacements in stock, I needed to wait on the back order.  No degree of explaining to the rep that I already had the LCD replaced under their plan would make him understand that the information he was giving me was inaccurate. He quickly offered to cancel the claim for me, then I called Verizon and canceled the coverage. I paid less to have the screen replaced at a local repair shop.  I'll never go back."

I’m not sure where the 5 star reviews…,Gary Pallavicini,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-03-15T23:59:01.000Z,,I’m not sure where the 5 star reviews are coming from but my guess is it is there own employees.  This is the worst company I’ve ever dealt with. They ask security questions from 25 years ago that only the best of memories would know. I gave them my account # gave them my address gave them my phone number even offered my SS number but they would not accept any of them. After taking to supervisor he said they would only process claim if I sent them affidavit and drivers license. I went down to AT&T they gave me affidavit and took pic of my license and sent it to Asurion. My wife and I have been with AT&T for over 20 years. I am authorized user. They now will not process claim because she is primary account holder!  WTH? It’s my phone my number that is broke. THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY!!!!! Finding every reason not to instead of taking care of it simply. DO NOT BUY INSURANCE FROM AT&T it’s not there own coverage it is a cut rate company trying not to process claims. There security questions are unreasonable and designed to help them not pay claims. I wish I didn’t have to give them 1 star. Horrible horrible experience!!!! Stay away your monthly payment for insurance on your phone is only to pad there pockets!!!!!!!!

Having Total Mobile Protection (TMP) is…,CINDY J,,US,2 reviews,2018-03-15T03:19:59.000Z,,"Having Total Mobile Protection (TMP) is great! The downfall is that is misleading from my phone carrier. Only three lines are covered per year. If it's ""Total"" then all ten of my lines should be covered and not have to pay for coverage on each additional line. That additional Mobile Protection coverage (MP) should reflect online when trying to file a fourth claim. Next, when a claim is filed under a phone number then that number is changed through phone carrier then that should follow over to Asurion. Same phone but different number. Who remembers previous numbers? Proper documentation should be on record/file so a person doesn't have to keep repeating oneself each time calling in. Also, when sending a replacement phone and person prefers to pick up, please make sure that pick up location isn't miles away. In your next team meeting use my account as a prime example. In approx one month I've had to replace two different phone lines, same phones, five to six times with same issue. Customer service rep (CSR) should make sure transfer is to correct department (warranty) and not bounce a person from place to place. When sending a replacement phone: 1. Why not an indirect signature i.e signing the door tag or something online 2. Have a delivery time window i.e 8a-12p, 12p-4p or 4p-8p and ask the customer what's a good time window 3.Saturday delivery option with time windows 4. Collaborate with the phone carrier.  Some of the replacement phone cost deductibles are ridiculously expensive. Seems like paying TMP or MP  would help defray that cost. Lastly, thanks for the expediant delivery of my phones. Well, with all of the confusion I got not one but two phones for both lines in two days. The additional phones have been sent back. I certainly don't want to be charged for an oversight. 😉"

At a modest $7.99 a month average I have spent well over $2,000 plus this $150 to get a reconditioned phone. Doesn’t quite seem fair.

I used my insurance and they did in fact send me a new phone after I paid my deductible of approx. $150 then they sent me an email saying that they were cancelling the policy. The monthly premiums I paid since I received the phone +the deductible still totalled out to more than sending my broken phone to Google and getting a new phone would have cost.To asurion: if you would like to reach out to me and re-instate my policy I would be happy to edit my review to note that.

Never AGAIN will I use Asurion,Sharilynn Boelk,,US,1 review,2018-03-13T16:57:22.000Z,,They scheduled a vendor to come out who didn’t show up or call. Took another 2 weeks to get a different vendor set up... each time I had to call in to see the status because they didn’t update me and when I called in the customer service was horrible and unhelpful. They cut me off and we’re short and rude to me when asking questions. Finally got a vendor set to come out and the vendor had to order a part for the washing machine. Assurion said the part was back ordered but it wasn’t. They just lied about remembering to order the part. I verified through this with the invoices I got. So by this time it’s taken 2 months and obviously we’ve had to do laundry at a laundry mat with a family of 4. They told me that I would get reimbursed for all the funds as long as I provide proof... nope found out later that it’s only a certain amount. So here we are 3 months later still washing machine not fixed. If I didn’t assist them in doing their job it probably would take longer! I’ll never purchase warranties through this company again. Not that they care.

Customer Service and Product Exchange,Joshua Fair,,US,1 review,2018-03-12T21:27:35.000Z,,"Customer Service and Product ExchangeI don't normally comment on poor service.  However when it is really bad I think I have a responsibility to alert other consumers.I've had Asurion for 30 months.  I have paid all my primiums and costs.  I did bear my phone 13 months ago and they replaced it with a refurbished phone (something I didn't know) and it worked fine.  About 5 months ago it started working slower and slower.  The solution is a replacement battery.  When I took it to the store to replace at my cost, they would not as the phone had been tampered with and had non-authorized parts added to it.I called Asurion about this and they assured me they would replace the tampered with phone.  After serveral hours of paper work and about 5 days they let me know they would not honor sending me a quality product as I had gone over 12 months since I got the phone.  I went to customer services and 2 levels of supervisors who had quite an uncaring viewpoint that they had sent me tampered with product and saw no problem with not having to be responsible for their having originally sent me an altered product.  There is a thing called ""Criminal Exchance"".  I paid all my dues to Asurion and kept my side of the bargain.  They sent me a tampered with product that I could not even get repaired (unlike my original phone) and they think this is the correct level of exchange and would not honor a quality exchange.I would advise anyone to stay away from them and their service at this stage of the game."

Received another broken/faultly phone in return. Customer service is about 50/50 on pleasentness though they all blatently lie or do not understand what they're telling you(I.e. James employee #145699) . Expect to be lied too mutiple times, be called a liar/talked over, and lastly accused of fraud. Very unprofessional and untruthful overall. Thank God my phone is almost paid off and I will no longer need them."

I tried to have it replaced and the first agent I talked to wanted me to do a hard reset on it. I didn't have another device to back it up to. I eventually hung up on him because I wasn't willing to lose all of my pics due to getting a defective device. Days later I called back again and had an amazing representative who sent me another replacement without making me lose all of my info. It's too bad I didn't get to talk to her In  the first place.

Poorly Refurbished Phone,Karyn Leitner ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-03-12T12:55:27.000Z,,"My daughter had an iPhone 6 Plus with a cracked screen. She called Assurion, put in a claim, paid a hefty deductible and received a phone. It worked for about 5 months and will now no longer charge, leaving her with no phone. She took the phone to Apple. Apple said the phone was refurbished with an after market screen  (not Apple), and that these parts caused problems with the phones internal board.  They did document the problem and gave her a copy stating that the problem was caused by the phone repair. . They said they have tons of problems with Assurion refurbished phones and recommended she not get another one. I began calling Asurion  for her today . It took me 5 phone calls and a Verizon rep ( my carrier is (AT&T),  The Assurion associate could not help me, sent me back to AT&T who ordered the wrong phone and can not cancel  it. Also, this would be another refurbished phone. Now we must wait for the wrong phone and send it back. Asurion must make certain that before buying their insurance ALL customers are told that replacement phones are refurbished and that Apple certified parts are not used on Apple products.ThIs needs  to be in bold print on their web site. As a side note, my son had a similar problem, went to Apple and it cost him less and he can maintain his Apple warranty .I have had insurance on our phones through AT&T since 1996."

My iPhone had a cracked screen,Stacy Synstelien,,US,2 reviews,2018-03-09T16:30:15.000Z,,My iPhone had a cracked screen. I reported the incident and need for a new screen.  The phone still worked and just had a cracked screen.  Asurion sent a refurbished phone that had a battery so hot i couldn't touch it.   Sent a second phone and the screen didn't respond.   Cancelled the request and sent the phone back.  Put in a request for a screen repair.  Technincan repaired the screen and now my screen only responds after pushing the letter or number 3 times.  Seriously i paid $89 to have you break my phone all while paying a monthly fee for nothing.  No response from Asurion either.  Save your money and don't get the insurance.

Decent first claim with Asurion 7/10,JENNIFER J,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-03-07T19:57:19.000Z,,"I made a claim in the Verizon retail office, found out what my options were.  That needed a little coaxing, My options were not very well explained as I was just given what I got.  It felt like the person on the other end was so used to putting in claims and sending out phones that not really explaining things to a customer on options wasn't even a thought.  The customer service was professional and mildly friendly.  Once I got the box, the 10 day grace period was great.  The instructions were pretty clear. Unfortunately, I didn't fully understand the sim card bit.  OK, I keep the old one, put in the new one in the new phone, but what do I do with the old sim and why is it so important that I keep it.  Otherwise thank you for your services."

Also heard that “I had to do a manual claim” that “the claim had to be sent away for approval somewhere else”.  Mind you, this was a garden variety “dropped my phone and screen shattered” claim for an iphone 6plus.  They did in the end give me an iphone 8 plus as a replacement, but I use my phone for business and this was 20 pounds of bull excrement.  Also their level of care about their service was 0 ducks given.  So that was great."

You cannot go back to check to make sure you filled information correctly so you have to cancel the claim and when you do that and try to re do the claim they try to make you fill out legal documents with sending in pictures of your ID and other sensitive information. Make it possible to go back to each window you visited before! Worst insurance company I have ever had to deal with

Followed by . . if you do not take your phone off icloud, you will be billed $500.  AND if that wasn't enought . . .I was billed $200. for a replacement phone which turned out to be a refurbished phone.

Asurion Fail,Traci,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-02-16T19:54:39.000Z,,"I was happy to see that Asurion offered repair options for cracked screens. I made my claim, and setup my appointment for repair on 02/14* My screen was damaged on 02/14/18 while I was at work, and after work I learned that someone hit my parked car which made it unable to drive.*I REALLY NEED A FUNCTIONING PHONE NOW*I filed my claim, and was told that a person will arrive the next day 02/15 between 3-5PM. I foolishly set  it  up to have them go to my work to repair the device, but reschedule my appointment to my residence once I realized that I will not have a rental car in time to go to work.*I was able to reschedule for a same day appointment! I was told a repair person will arrive between 5-7PM. No Call, No Show, No FixI called Asuion on 02/16/18 to inquire why no one showed up or called. Through conversation with the Asurion rep I learned that these repair services they offer now are through a 3rd party, so you know (wink, wink) bad 3rd party. Not us, Asurion, but 3rd party.This 3rd party company that Asurion entrust with its customers lied to Asurion about contacting me. Asurion goes off whatever the 3rd party tells them, and they add the info to your account. According to the Asurion rep the 3rd party notified Asurion (not me) that they did not have my replacement part..I was told that the 3rd party claimed to have sent me something stating all of this. Not true.On 02/15 I was busy working with two different car insurances and Asurion for my phone. Asurion is the insurance company that failed me, not the two auto insurance companies. Isn't that something in itself.My conversation today 02/16 was annoying. I only contacted them for my $30 refund. There's no repercussions for the inncovience and even though I pay monthly for Asurion I will have to find an alternative repair on my own. Although, I was offered to purchase a replacement phone from Asurion for $100.WTH. Total B.S. it's a cracked screen! Leave it to my cell phone insurance to attempt to take advantage of me.Fyi Asurion. I would have liked to know before hand that you were not sending an Asurion employee to my home. I actually try to limit these 3rd party contracted people for even coming to my residence."

STAY AWAY!! Underhanded practices...,kljwat,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-02-14T18:20:32.000Z,,My replacement device began to quickly deteriorate and now will no longer power/stay on unless connected to a charger. This suspiciously began right after the 12 month warranty Asurion provides. My phone began the downward spiral during Hurricane Harvey and I did not have any other way to contact friends or family. AT&T checked my device and notified me that Asurion provided me a replacement device with a defective battery. I've contacted Asurion multiple times and was provided with zero assistance. The only thing Asurion seemed concerned about was the additional deductible they wanted me to provide. This second deductible would be double the previous amount and I'd essentially be paying Asurion for the defective device they sent. The 12 month warranty is a bait and switch lining Asurion's cold crooked pockets.

But happily kept my money. Warning!!! Do not give this company a Penny!!!I have called the company many times to just get disconnected by a supervisor. I have gone out and purchased a new dishwasher from another company that does not use asurion as an extended warranty company.

Nothing like paying full price for something worth half that elsewhere.Not to mention that absolutely horrible customer service. I had to have my verizon rep on the line in a 3 way call just to get them to honor their insurance policy I already paid for.  After several days, calls, and more than 4 hours on hold or talking to a representative, I was given the privaledge of paying way to much for old tech.

Cancelled Payments - Waste Of Mine and Your Money,Savannah Kemp,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CA,1 review,2018-02-04T18:59:25.000Z,,"When you hear others talking about scams you never imagine that the employee at The Source (Canada) , a business you thought you could trust, would be trying to sell one to you. However it happens people, and this Insurance company is a huge waste of money. I’m a Bell Mobility user and I have an iPhone 6s that I bought at full price with no contract In July. I paid 900$ and some for the phone which is now worth around 600$. Now listen to this, and bear with me because it is dicey. With Bell right now you can upgrade to get the same phone I have 6s 32 gb for 129.00, I know what you’re thinking; That’s on a contract and I’m not on a contract. but it doesn’t make a difference if you were already on one or not. Its still 129.00$ to upgrade renewing your contract while Asurion charges you 279.00$ for a Iphone 6s when I pay them 11$ a month. So if I was on a contract I’d be paying Bell a deductable for the phone, plus I’d be paying Asurion for Insurance when I could just not pay the insurance company anything save 11$ and renew my contract is anything happened to the phone. So I called the insurance company and the first employee I talked to directed me back to Bell whom directed me back to the Insurance Company whom directed me to some type of supervisor. I told the man my problem and he told me that the benefit of paying 11$ a month is that I don’t have to renew my contract or get on a contract. Then he proceeded to list the price of an Iphone 6s Plus brand new and what it would cost me, Mind you I have an Iphone 6s 32 GB. Technically this is correct that if I wanted to go buy my iPhone brand new it would be cheaper to pay the insurance company the cost.. In my situation however if you’re already on a contract, no way, you’re paying this insurance company 11$ for no reason. Not to mention all the other hidden secrets this company has, that I learned about from the comment sections on their Facebook. There’s literally no good reviews. When the employee at The Source sold me on this company for the second time they had told me it was 150$ to replace it if it was lost/stolen or water damaged, and free if you have the phone but it’s just damaged. This is so far from the truth even I’m laughing, so people before you have to learn from you’re own experience; learn from mine. It cost me about 120$ a year, and a lot more in time. Do your research before naively believing retail employees with these ridiculous warrantees/insurance companies. Because yes with Bell billing issues are just a phone call away from being solved but not with third party companies like Asurion. I told the man I was talking to who was supposed to be a supervisor that I was requesting a refund in my money for the insurance on the 6s since July since I was cancelling it and 100% dissatisfied with the company. Not suprisingly this request was denied with a friendly have a wonderful day, so the lesson is to not trust Employees at companies like the Source as well as I have been over the years. Do your research before you blindly agree to monthly payments for “insurance” purposes, because sometimes- they offer you no insurance."

First I am doing all the work.,"Latrika-Creola,AL",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-01-31T23:39:13.000Z,,"First I am doing all the work. I  was told to send photos of my television to the technician. After the photos was sent an appointment was set. I took off work to be home when the tech arrived. The tech never arrived to the appointment. So I called the tech, and was told to check my email because he was told not to come to the appointment. The tech tells me that Walmart will be sending me an email. I checked my email there was nothing there from walmart. After many phone calls I'm told by the care plan center  that I have a crack in my television.  I tell them there is no crack on the television. The care plan center  tells me the crack is inside of the television not on the outside. How dose a television crack itself on the inside? I may have been more accepting of the statement if my television was in an area accessible by the whole family, however that is not the case. I was told my television will not be fixed and my television will not be replaced.  The process was not professionally done. I am still waiting on something in writing telling me the findings from the tech and an explanation as why my television is not covered. What is the plan for?"
Wiped my phone but had a new one in 15hrs.,Ronni P,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-01-31T22:37:23.000Z,,There was a little more paperwork than I expected. But that was fine. I broke my phone at 7PM and had a new phone by 10AM the next day. My only complaint was they asked you to delete find my iphone and being the proactive person I am I did it right away. The directions weren't clear and I ended up erasing my entire phone!!! Surprisingly I wasn't more upset probably because I had a new one so quickly.

Deductible cost is more than repair cost and claim process is ridiculous,David Lord,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-01-26T21:04:35.000Z,,"We have had Asurion insurance on my daughter's iPhone7 for more than a year at $8.99/mth. She cracked her screen and we went to file a claim. Online claim process has you complete everything online only to require you to print and hand complete the same information on an affidavit. As we tried to complete the process, we learned there is a $169 deductible for a screen replacement repair that is only $150 at Apple and $100 elsewhere. This is a complete and total SCAM from our perspective. NEVER AGAIN! I suspect none of these reviews are making it to the Asurion website nor being factored into their displayed rating."

Obtaining Warrant Service,M.

Asurion is fast and good - except sometimes...,KENNETH L,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-01-24T02:50:42.000Z,,"I've used Asurion at least three times.  The first two or three were quick and without problem.  This last time there was more than a week involved in about four or five very time consuming and frustrating attempts, well more than 7 hours of total time - to get Asurion to accept the claim.That wasn't helped by some technical reason I could not get their web site to respond, and they could not suggest a solution.But at least I was finally able to talk to a real person, and we thought the claim was processed: but after a few days, when I checked again, it was still hung up.  Finally, after talking with yet another person, I had to submit more even more documents. After that, I got my replacement phone within two days. My good experiences still outweigh my bad - when things all work as they expect, Asurion is set up to respond quickly and well.  If you expect the unexpected, however, it might take a bit longer...."

Not only do I thank Asurion for this, though unexpected for a recognized watch manufacturer, but also the company Amazon, who holds its partners to such high standards, that I reordered the same watch again from Amazon.I have to applaud this style of business, coming from the past trust I've had of American business, which lately has come under increased scrutiny and criticism"

Not a customer focused experience,Matt Belle,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-01-17T02:48:18.000Z,,"From my experience replacing my stolen phone, it is clear that Asurion is more concerned about being ripped off by their customers than they are about an expedient and easy customer experience.  Every time they had a question about the phone or needed another document, I received an email.  Unfortunately, most of us do most our emailing on our phones nowadays and this caused delays that could have been avoided if they 1) collected payment info and verified shipping address at the time of the claim and 2) used the alternative contact number they requested, rather than email.  The car insurance I carry covers over $60,000 worth of automobiles and offload toys with full coverage for just over $130/month.  If I were in an accident, I am immediately offered a ride, a loaner is part of the claim,  I get a new vehicle that is equal in value and the deductible is $500.  I pay $17/month for iPhone insurance and when I have to make a claim, get treated with suspicion, no loaner is offered, have to wait several days for a new phone to arrive and it is a refurbished phone that is probably worth $400.  The deductible is half the cost of the phone.  Why can't I just upgrade to a new phone and have Asurion and Sprint figure out the return?   I will receive a refurbished phone in the mail tomorrow and then have to go to a sprint store to return it.  What a waste of time and resources!  Bottom line Asurion is more interested in covering their own interests and not the customer's."

Worked out pretty good except took a long time and I had to go uy him a pohone on the interim.  Also, no mention was ever made of sending the broken one back any where in the process.  Then I got a request 2 or more weeks after the process to return the broken phone.  I held on to it for 2 weeks just in case and figured it was safe to dispose of after that time so I was very surprised you asked me to return it weeks after the new phone arrived.  I had just pitched it so I could not comply.  I recommend making that known up front & I would have been able to return he broken one"

Plan on a day and a few trips to cell provider to get claim taken care of,Joshua Jennings,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-01-05T05:32:35.000Z,,Have made claims in the past and it was easy! It was much harder this time and they declined it saying my phone was not active at time off loss! This makes no sense and was not the case! If they are going to waste half my day filing a claim just to deny it then they should not be taking my money every month! Not only that but it looks bad on Verizon who sales the insurance plan! It feels like the big corporations along with apple slowing down are phones and making it so we have to get a new 1000 dollar phone is dishonest.  Just provid customer service and be honest !  You can only skin a cat once!  People will stop doing business with companies like these.

When my husband washed his phone I assumed it would be easy to replace. During first call I was asked to verify my address from 30 years ago, which I could not remember. Due to this a hold was put on my claim. When no one contacted me, I called back and was told I needed to download a form, get a copy of my DL and send it back which I did. Someone called me later that day and said I could complete my claim on line. When doing so I found they were wanting to replace my husbands new iPhone SE with an iPhone 6. We bought the SE because that was the phone we wanted. I was told to call every day to see if it was in stock yet. We’re going on five days of my husband having no phone. Today I was told they may not ever get them in. I’m really dissatisfied in the service I’m receiving. If anything changes I’ll update my review."

From bad to worse,A Wilson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-12-30T20:02:57.000Z,,"After one phone call with an Asurion rep who put me on hold after 20 minutes and then sent me to a message saying they could not help me and cut off the call, I then spent two hours on the phone with AT&T and Asurion (who was doubting my coverage that AT&T was confirming I had), Asurion verbally accepted that I had coverage and I filed a claim.  Six days later Asurion sent a letter saying it denied the claim because I had no coverage.  I had already decided to cancel the coverage because after saying they would cover a screen replacement, they changed their mind saying they were sending a replacement phone - which was fine until I found out they were replacing my less than a week old phone with a ""refurbished"" one.  I sent back the refurbished phone and went to CPR here in town.  In one hour they replaced my screen on my new phone for $75 less than the insurance deductible.  I am glad others are having good experiences but I cannot believe I am the only one who has had a terrible experience."

They referred me to Walmart mobile care.  I called Walmart mobile care explained them situation, they asked me to send phone and receipts.  I sent receipts and phone around four month back and called customer care to confirm.  Customer care charged me 40$ and told me that I will get new phone back.  After month I called to check status of the request and customer care told me your claim is denied.  After having discussion with Walmart store and Walmart mobile care I was asked to contact to store again.  As a result of discussion with Walmart store I requested my phone back.  Initially they lied that phone is sent to me and asked me to wait, on second call asked me to file police case as phone is lost.  After giving police case number now told me that they destroyed phone and can not give me neither phone not money.  Though I was not care plan customer they have no right to destroy my phone."

worst experience ever,Haleigh Victoria Mintz,,US,1 review,2017-12-21T19:44:07.000Z,,"I have had the absolute worst experience with this company. First off, I have been trying to get my phone for over half a month now. My phone was stolen along with my debit card, insurance card and ID and Asurion wanted me to send in a picture of my photo ID (which obviously I could not). I was able to find an old expired ID which, although expired, contained my correct full name and DL number. I paired this with my SS card in hopes that it would give credit to my expired ID. Of course, Asurion declined these documents. I spoke on the phone with a lady and told her my current ID was stolen along with my phone and this was the best I had until I got my ID in the mail and she told me to resend the same documents and that she would put a note in my file. I did, and of course had to wait another 24 hours before I heard back (for the second time). I finally got an email and called to once again be told that my documents were declined due to them being expired. I informed this second lady that I had already spoken to someone about the issue and that she was supposed to have put a note in my file and had told me to resend the same documents. The second lady put me on hold and transferred me to another more directly related lady who I had to explain everything to for the 3rd time. She asked if I could send in a paper copy which I could not because I ordered it online. I told her I might be able to find an email and she said if it contained the correct information they needed (which she did not inform me of what this information was exactly, obviously not my DL number) then they would accept it. She then also claimed to have put a note in my file. I checked my email and it didn't have any personal information on it whatsoever so I knew it wouldn't do any good and these people wouldn't accept anything less than a current valid photo ID which I would have to wait until I got. I finally received my ID and got my claim accepted to be able to order another phone. When I went to input all of the payment and shipping information, I had to change the address my phone was being sent to because they had auto-filled the blank with an old address they had on file. Because of this, once I hit complete I once AGAIN got a notice that my claim was under review and to check back in 24 hours. At this point I am extremely annoyed as I had already been waiting so long simply to be able to have my phone on its way to me. The next day, I got an email that said I can move on to the next step of the claim, however, when I went to the website my old address was once again auto-filled in the blank. I didn't want a repeat of what happened last time so I called sprint directly and had my address changed and had it processed immediately so that I could have my phone sent to my current address. I then went back on the Asurion website once more and completed the process yet again. Checking back later, the website assured me that my phone was on its way and would be there the next day. This was perfect timing because I made sure my package had to be signed for and I was home for that day. The next day I went to check the shipping status only to find that Asurion had taken me back to the payment page as if nothing ever happened. Confused, I called and talked to a lady who told me it was because my phone was on back order but that they were getting a shipment of it that day and I'd have my phone by tomorrow. I asked her what happened to the $250 I spent on my deductible and she said it was just to reserve the phone for me. To which I asked if I'd have to shell out another $250, because if so I might as well just get another brand new phone instead of going around in circles with these people for over half a month. She said no I wouldn't have to pay again, it would just be the next day when I received my phone. I called later and spoke to a man that said I would have to go back and complete the information and payment process all over again, contrary to what the lady told me. At this point I'm furious from all the waiting and misinformation. I went back and completed the process again once I made sure I wasn't charged for the $250 the first time. Once completed I finally received an email saying my phone would be there the NEXT day. I took off of work so I could made sure I was here to sign for my phone. Today, I went to fed ex to track my package and I see that the city it shows that it's being delivered to is different from the city I have on file and entered when I filled everything out to have my phone sent to me. Completely done at this point, I called for the millionth time and spoke to a lady who said they made a mistake on their end (go figure) and it was too late to change the address now because it was already on transit and I'd have to wait yet another day. I informed her that I had my package require a signature and that I had taken off of work so I'd be able to sign for it and that I couldn't take off of work the next day. Because of this, I now have the package supposedly coming to my workplace tomorrow. I have zero hopes that everything will go as planned because time and time again this company has royally F'ed everything up. I STILL don't have a phone, and I'm just hoping my phone isn't stolen from the house they are delivering it to because THEY apparently don't know how type in a simple address correctly. If I had a choice over which insurance company to go through for my phone, it wouldn't be this one. Worst experience ever, and all they can offer is a ""sorry""."

Really bad service.,Marissa Glaser,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-12-21T00:43:12.000Z,,"I've made use of Asurion twice. The first time, I chose reimbursement, and received an e-gift card within 24 hours of returning my broken phone. I was very pleased, and recommended this protection plan to many people. Unfortunately, last week, I chose replacement, and Asurion didn't take any action to replace my phone until FIVE DAYS after I mailed it off. The representative I spoke with had no record of my new phone being sent out. After he made a note, it took THREE DAYS for Asurion to adjust my claim status to where I'll be issued an e-gift card within the next two days. As it stands, I'll be without a phone for 9 to 10 days. I wish there was a way to mitigate my losses, and keep recommending Asurion, but, for now, I can't."

Worst customer service experience I have had in years!!!!!,Kathy Platt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-12-14T01:43:24.000Z,,"First let me say that we have had phone through Verizon for 23 years and have used Asurion and PAID Asurion for as long as they have been affiliated with Verizon.I had the most horrendous experience with Asurion today that I have had with any company in years!   I had a confirmed appointment today for repair of a cracked screen.  It took 5 days to get this repair scheduled. It was confirmed by text and email.  I left work early to be at home during the repair window.  Sat for 2 hours waiting for my appointment time to come and go.  At the end of the two hours I called the number provided on my email appointment confirmation.  Customer service representative #1 tried to schedule a repair appointment for me not realizing I had been sitting and waiting for two hours.  #2 Supervisor claimed that the tech did not have the ""part"" and had left a message for me at 3:05 pm to reschedule.  There is no message or missed call on any of our family's four phones.  The only thing they could do is send a new phone for $149 or schedule a repair again a week out. #3 Floor Supervisor could do nothing other than make the same offer of a new phone for $149 or a new appointment a week out.  #4 Corporate Office employee Marilyn Gualty in Customer Services (would not give me her title) now claims a tech called us a 9:15 am.  No technician called at any time today.  She claimed she could do nothing else other than offer me a $25 gift card, a $149 phone or another week of waiting.  Not one of the four customer service reps could tell us the name of the tech, the phone number they supposedly called, the phone number to call back the tech.   This was a complete waste of my time, now taking from when I left my office at 4:45 pm until I hung up the phone with customer services at 8 pm.  The last representative asked If I would like to take the survey on my experience to which I gladly replied YES!  To add insult to injury the survey was malfunctioning and whether I said the rating number or entered my rating number on my phone, the survey asked my the same questions  over and over again in a loop!  Not even the feedback survey provided good customer service.If Asurion is a customer service company, then they have failed.  If no customer service person has the power or authority to fix the problem then there is a significant problem with this company.  If Asurion uses contract techs that cannot  be trusted to show up and that lie about leaving a message, then they can't guarantee their customer service.   We have paid for Asurion insurance for multiple phones for over 6 years and only made one claim other than this one.  We will be dropping Asurion for Apple Care and believe me we will tell everyone we know thanks to social media.  We have also called Verizon customer service to register our complaint referencing our claim number."

They said me you already had claims with your previous phone. But already I had been paid ever payment of that phone and I bought a new phone and I got new insurance. And I pay for insurance. Now I don’t have any phone and I have to pay 105$ every month for nothing! They didn’t send any phone and I can’t cancel the payment. I have to pay all them together.

Terrible customer service!,misty hudson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2017-11-27T21:38:51.000Z,,"Terrible customer service!I began filing a claim for my damaged phone on 11/24/17.  I began my claim at a Verizon store, and was told to complete my claim online at home. Even though I had an email from Asurion stating that I needed to complete my claim, their website would not allow me to do so, and kept telling me I needed to call customer service. I had to wait until a neighbor got home to call from their phone to file my claim.  This call ended up being ~1 hour due to the customer service representative being very unhelpful (stated he could  not ship my replacement phone to my address unless there was someone to sign for it). I offered alternatives (shipping the device to the Verizon store , shipping the device to my place of employment), but he continued stating that it could only be shipped to my home address and someone must be present to sign for the package.  After requesting to speak to a manager repeatedly, he finally agreed to have it shipped to my work address, but stated there would be a hold on the claim until the following day, but that the phone would still be received on Monday as long as I submitted my deductible payment upon receiving the email.  Prior to asking for a manager, the representative even suggested taking off work in order to wait for my device to arrive at home on Monday (thankful I didn't do that as now the phone isn't being delivered until Tueday). I received an email Saturday am, stating that my claim was approved, and paid my $149 deductible.  I waited until 3:00 on Monday for my phone to be delivered and then tracked the package.  UPS stated the package delivery date was being rescheduled for Tuesday, 11/28.  I called Asurion customer service to attempt to resolve this issue, as the device was supposed to have been delivered today, Monday, 11/27. After speaking to 4 agents total (the 1st told me there was no manager only a Care Solutions team), and the last two were evidently managers (even though I was told there were no managers), my issue is still not resolved. They stated they were unable to work with UPS to get my package delivered (or available for pick today), although UPS states the package is in my city, and that they ""do not compensate"" for anything because they are an insurance company.  After being on the phone for over an hour with Asurion today, I have no phone (hopefully it will actually be delivered tomorrow), and they would not refund any of my deductible. They offered to send me a gift card (1st $20, then $25, and finally $30).  Both managers also stated that the information the initial customer service with Asurion gave me (on Friday evening) was incorrect, and that the package could have been delivered to my home address with no signature required (and this would have resulted in the claim being completed Friday evening and my package would have been here today). Asurion's customer service is terrible, and I will be cancelling with them as soon as my replacement device is received.  They do not take accountability for their mistakes, and continuously state ""we do not compensate, as we are an insurance company.""  I do not recommend this company at all, and will no longer be using them."

To be your best, you will need to fundamentally decide that keeping your promises must be accomplished.

The custumer service representative hung up on me before I had the chance to even say have a good day or even bye . So disrespectful and thats because I was trying conplain the nicest way possible.

Completely Dishonest and Dishonourable Company,Doug Kropp,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-11-24T02:35:15.000Z,,"Absolutely terrible service. Dishonest and dishonourable. Asurion refused to replace my iphone when it was stolen. First they denied the claim by making up a new bogus rule, which wasn't in the terms and conditions of the phone protection plan insurance contract.  They said I needed to have used ""airtime"" on the day of the loss, which of course is not a requirement of the contract. When I pointed that out to them, they then said they were going to deny the claim because people were still calling the number after it was stolen. I pointed out that all I can do is have the service provider block the phone and SIM card from being used for outgoing calls and texts and for data use (which I did), but I can't stop incoming calls from people who don't know the phone has been stolen. There is nothing I can do about that. My service provider verified for Asurion that my phone was stolen and that it had been blocked and blacklisted so that no-one could use it on any network and that the only activity now is attempted (incompleted) incoming calls. My service provider also asked Asurion to honour the contract and replace my phone, but Asurion still refused.  Asurion also refused to put the denial of the claim or the reasons for the denial in writing. They also told me there was no appeal or dispute resolution process and that the decision was final and that there was nothing I could do about it. They clearly had no intention of honouring the contract and were making up bogus excuses to try to justify denying the claim."

Worst customer service around!,Neil & Jessica Gorman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-11-23T13:06:14.000Z,,"I NEVER write reviews on anything, but am so outraged with the hours I have spent on the phone with Asurion, getting nowhere, I have to warn others. The end of October one of our iphones was closed in a door and glass was cracked with glass pieces coming out everywhere. Much to my surprise it still could text and take calls, so it went in a zip lock and we continued to use it. Immediately, I called Asurion to place a claim and was told it was on ""back order"" so it would take 7-10 days to get a new phone. On day 10, the phone still hadn't arrived. Placed call and was told it was still on back order and they would cut me a check, minus my $250 deductible. I agreed on the check at this point and waited and waited for the check to come. It finally arrived 18 days after I placed my claim! They had also told me they would provide a receipt after my check was processed showing my deductible because my screen protection company will reimburse me part of my deductible. (On this phone call, they told me they would email me a reciept if I called once receiving the check.) After hours of being on the phone with them (and on hold for ""1-2 minutes"" repeatedly), transferred from person to person, who each tell me a different story, I am told that they cannot send me a receipt, I need to wait until it shows up on my AT&T bill, which will show in 1-2 billing cycles. Well, the screen protection insurance company, who is very efficient, had sent me a new screen protector in 2 days after a 5 minute phone call, but would need the receipt within 60 days to issue a refund on the deductible. The Asurion representatives I spoke with really didn't seem to care. So I took the check, went to Apple to purchase a new iPhone and purchased the Apple Care along with it, which I should have done from day 1! Apple Care is actually much cheaper, their deductables are less expensive and their customer service is phenomenal.  If I had Apple Care from the start, I would have had my new phone the day it broke and the receipt to go along with it, with an extra $100 in my pocket. Lesson learned."

My previous experience with the warranty was a pain and this one is 10x worst. The email for return shipping info never works. Then you have call back and go through the entire process again. Last warranty took 3 weeks to even get to shipping the product back. This time im at a month already trying to return the product. I will never use the plan again. You buy the product and each time it breaks they say there is none in stock and refund the money, but then they charge you 40$ to refund your money. So basically you pay 60 for the warranty and another 40 to use the warranty to be left with no product, a hassle to get what money is left, and having to buy another one on your own. Pointless."

Difficult initially but in the end it worked out,Dave,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2017-12-20T15:48:29.000Z,,"Update: Changing review to 3 stars from 1 star. Shortly after writing this I was actually able to chat with the first representative who was able to get me a tracking label immediately and stayed on line with me to confirm receipt. The processing of the warranty claim was great after the initial issues. So, although I had issues initially, once I was actually able to get a return label I was happy with the experience. Initial Review: I have been trying for over a month to get a return label for a claim submitted on a product I purchased. The site status says my return shipping label is on its way for over a month now. I have had 3 chat sessions now with support and each time they say I will have a label emailed within 2 hours. I never get it. They state my email provider may be blocking or sending to spam but I have tried multiple providers with the same result (Yahoo and Gmail). Plus I am receiving the chat transcripts just fine from the asurion.com domain and if those aren't blocked, the label would not be either. There is no way that I can find to contact them by phone, it is always via chat, and the response is always the same. To be honest I think they make people jump through as many hoops as possible to get them to give up and have no intention of actually honoring the warranty they sold. At this point I am left with few options other than filing a BBB complaint, a complaint to my state Attorney General and to Amazon where I purchased the warranty. Although I think Amazon stopped using them as the warranties now appear to be offered through Square Trade and I can see why."

Asurion is THE WORST,Tiffanny R. Golston,,US,1 review,2017-11-04T00:07:05.000Z,,"Asurion is THE WORST company on the planet. Given that they have a monopoly on cell insurance, customers are forced to deal with their awful customer service, confusing policies, and frustrating phone trees. I called Asurion on 10/29 to file a claim for my son's defective phone. When he still had not received it by 11/3, I called back. After several transfers, I was told that the phone was on backorder for 7-10 days. Each person that I was transferred to seemed to be more concerned with proving that I was already told this than handling my concern. When I finally spoke with Julie, the ""manager"", she again reiterated (like that was necessary) that the phone was on backorder and I should have gotten an email. At this point I'm at the height of my anger, and Julie offers to mail me a check for the retail value of the phone so that I can go to the store to purchase a new one. The check takes 8 days to arrive and they subtract their $225 deductible from that amount. At this point I ask her if this makes sense to her. My concern is that my son is away at college with no phone access. Her resolution is to cancel the order for the phone that's on its way so that we can wait another 8-10 days for a check that DOES NOT cover the price of a phone once they take out their fees. This company is a joke. It's consistently poor ratings from actual customers never appear on their site. My advice to anyone needing cell insurance is to explore other options. ANY OTHER OPTION!!!!"

When calling customer service not only you have people who won't listen to what you have to say, but they hung up on you!!! They are stating that it's something wrong with my e-mail if I didn't receive the gift card (except I did receive any other e-mail the've sent!!!) When I asked the person to repeat my e-mail address, so we can see if they have right e-mail on file, she provides me with a wrong one and that is my fault! Couldn't be that she heard it wrong, and fist of all I asked for the e-mail on file, not the one she wrote down for herself!!! FYI, if I provided wrong e-mail, how did you check status of my claim???? Bad, bad, bad customer service!!! Rude!!!! Beware. I believe all those good reviews and stars to be not true at ALL!!!!!!!"

Asurion Gives you a refurb with a warranty for when it breaks AGAIN!,Bre P,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GB,2 reviews,2017-10-19T21:26:49.000Z,,"My phone had a software issue so I filed a claim. They sent me a refurbished phone that has a scratch across the back. I called to complain because I expected them to send me a new phone but apparently they just ""certified refurbish"" all the malfunctioning phones and reship them out. They add a 1 year warranty on the phone they send you because they expect it to have problems (again) and will send you another refurbished phone with a 1 year warranty for when it breaks again. They make so much money off of your monthly insurance payment and then give you crappy phones back. BEST PART is they don't offer a platform for social or online reviews. They give you a PO Box to mail your review in to. If they aren't progressive enough to have online reviews they probably aren't progressive enough to have certified refurbished staff handling all phone repairs."
Secondary Damage on products during repair,Chenming Jiang,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-10-19T17:28:48.000Z,,"I purchased a protection plan on my iPad mini2, which screen is cracked last month. So I send it to repair center and I received fixed iPad mini now with a big coin size dent on the back of it. It doesn't  show any function problems so far but it looks very bad. I think the protection plan should not make any further damage on the product by any way but fix the parts need repair. It doesn't make sense the Protection plan to make some damage on the protecting product, which is totally awful service and costumer like me won't buy it any more."

They tell me it has to be the same phone or a refurbished phone. I told them my phone is old and they probably don't make them anymore. They don't care, no one  has taken the initiative to call the service provider to ask if they could give me a different phone. No one has bothered to email or call me (I still check voicemail) and give me an update on the status of the claim. Staff is robotic and stick to the script. I have had to contact the service provider myself and complain about this awful experience. I worked in the insurance industry for 8 years. For a claim as simple as this insureds never had to wait they got the next best available item."

I called Asurion and they immediately sent a refurb phone, I got it the next day. So I went through the motions of setting up the refurb phone with the help from Asurion, the person was great. Of course nothing is easy so that phone decided it didn't want to work right either. Called Asurion again and once again another phone was shipped to me the next day.

Once they get you on the phone they claim you didn’t do this, when you follow their instructions and read to them what’s on the computer screen in front of you verifying that “no devices are found” on your iCloud account, they say they just needed you to verify that.

Dealing with Asurion is worse than dealing with AT&T and that says alot!!!,Allan Thompson,,US,2 reviews,2017-09-30T21:04:34.000Z,,"Tis has been the worst experience other than dealing with AT&T.  First, calling in is a nightmare because of all the trash you have to listen to before you can even begin to make a selection in their, ""who do you NOT want to talk to voice command system.  It never gives you the opportunity to talk to a real person.  Finally, after pressing this number than that number, I finally just pressed a bunch of zeros and finally got a person.  Start a claim and am sent an email to fill out the affidavit.Of course, it couldn't be simple where I can just download a pdf.  No, I have to enter the phone number, name and zip code only to be told the information is incorrect. The information is correct.  I notice there is a chat option.  So I click on it only to get a message that chat is closed and to try again between working hours of 9:00 am and 10:00 pm.  Considering it was only 4:00 pm why was I getting this message.Back to the phone........ugh!!!  They can't email me the form, they can only fax it.  So I give them the fax number to my office.  Drive 10 miles to the office only to get a 5 page fax with the statement, ""fax file missing.All this so I can pay a $10.00 deductible to replace a damaged $39.00 phone.Let's see if this review shows up on their webpage.

When describing my issue with my phone, I let them know that the claim wasn't even filed under the problem we had with the phone but I was accused of making a false claim. When I explained that my phone had suffered water damage and I explained that it fell in the toilet I was accused of just making it up. I'm absolutely appalled by this.

I received my phone the next day...on a Saturday.  Wonderful easy service.  I have used Asurion before, however my only complaint is....the phone I received must be a refurbished phone.  One of the features I purchased this exact phone model is the awesome battery life.  My replacement is terrible. I can't make it through a day on a charge with the replacement, where the brand new phone with it's battery would last two days.  That's my complaint.  Service, ease of use, delivery are all Excellent.  I just wished the replacement worked as well as the phone that was damaged, that I added insurance to just in case from the start."
I would recommend that nobody use this …,Mark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CA,5 reviews,2017-09-27T14:55:38.000Z,,"I would recommend that nobody use this company's insurance offering. I insured my mobile phone with Asurion through my carrier, Rogers Communications. I wasn't informed at the time of a deductible, nor was I informed that the 'replacement' phones would be used devices (though they were in the pages and pages of fine print of my contract). After almost two years of my phone working perfectly, I dropped it in water and required a replacement. The following is a brief synopsis of what happened. -Asurion charged me $200 to replace my phone. -The first phone had a battery life of only a couple hours-I asked for a replacement phone-The phone was glitchy and deleted all of my contacts over a period of a couple days-I asked for a replacement phone-The phone had a battery life as bad as the first phone-I'd had  enough and bought a new phone-Asurion offered to give me my money back (and nothing more, which means I paid for mobile phone replacement and got nothing in the end)-Asurion still hasn't refunded me my money over two months later (though they say that the will still do so). In the end, I paid fifteen bucks a month, or ($300) to Asurion and when I needed them the most, I also gave them a repairable phone and $200. What did I get in return? Nothing...as for the $200? I'm waiting with bated breath. This company is a total ripoff. Avoid them at all costs."

Borderline fraudulent practices,Jim Boswell,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GB,5 reviews,2017-09-25T01:17:34.000Z,,"I have used this insurance on two occasions within a years time. Both times I attempted to file the claim online and both times the claim hung up just as I was checking out while entering my shipping address. All the address fields received a green check mark except for the city and country. No matter how hard I tried to get the city (Bonita Springs) and country (USA) to be accepted, it would not be accepted! This happened for both of my claims. Each time I opened a chat with a customer service person who said they would fix it for me. They did not not fix the problem, allowed the session to timeout and left me with a message requiring me to produce affidavits, a photo ID, etc., to be faxed to them in order to complete my claim.  The first time I had to struggle through three or four customer service representatives that had no idea what I was talking about when I said that it was their system that was causing the problem and should not be my problem to have to solve, before I finally spoke to a supervisor that agreed with me and handled the problem professionally and sent me a replacement phone overnight. The second incident almost caused me to become apoplectic!!! Before losing my temper I went directly to a Corporate Verizon store and explained the situation to the store manager and showed him a screen shot of the final message from Asurion that appeared when I was checking out when the customer service representative said they would take care of it. The Verizon Manager intervened and called Asurion directly to resolve the problem and gave me a new phone right then and there.  The first time I encountered the problem with Asurion's online submission service, I figured it was a just a glitch and discussed it with the supervisor. She assured me that they would look into and get it fixed and agreed that there was no reason why the address field should not work properly.  But, when it occurred the second time months later, I can only suspect that it is an intentional, built-in, system error meant to add a level of difficulty to the process for users to frustrate us to the point where we just give up and forgo using the insurance all together.  Believe me, when you get on the phone with their customer service representatives and start discussing why you should not need to fill out an affidavit, etc., you will think you were talking to an animatronic doll preprogrammed with one message!!!"

Did not put compete address on my replacement package even though we confirmed the address 2 times and told them if it's incomplete it will not get delivered to me. When I called to let them know they told me to call shipping company. I called shipping company and was told Asrion put a restriction on it so they couldn't update address. Asrion had to update called Asrion back and was given the run around and told to call shipping company. I asked for a direct line in to customer srvice, and was told they didn't have a direct line. Then asked to speak with supervisor and was hung up on. If this is how u guys treat ur customers I will never use Asrion again."

Replacement phones are awful,Sarah Goldberg,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-09-19T18:37:33.000Z,,"Asurion NEEDS to improve their quality assurance practices. The replacement devices that they sent me have broken 4 times in the past 6 months, through no fault of my own. First, the screen on the phone they sent me died. Luckily, that phone was under Apple's warranty and they replaced it for free. Then, the phone stopped receiving power. Asurion replaced it. The NEW phone they sent me ALSO had screen issues, and then the battery stopped holding its charge. Quite simply, the ""replacement devices"" are pieces of crap. They are in no way an adequate replacement for the broken phone that I originally insured."

Because of this, I couldn't download my old music to the phone for 45 days (you cannot associate two IDs with one phone for a 90 day period). Now that I've waited the 45 days, I have my music, and everything is great. It was just annoying to have to do that when Asurion should have known about the 90 day wait period. Perhaps wait until 90 days from receiving refurbs to send them out as replacements in the future."

This company is ridiculous,Kory Kyler,,US,1 review,2017-08-19T15:30:26.000Z,,"This company is ridiculous. I broke my screen, went to the Verizon Store and they said to call this company to setup a claim. I filed a claim and had to pay a $50 deductable. I found out that day, that it was actually cheaper to get a new phone, so I did that. I called Asurion about an hour after the initial call and cancelled my appointment to have my phone screen repaired 2 days later. They said they would credit my $50 back to my account. 2 days later, an asurion repairman showed up to fix my phone and I explained I cancelled that appointment, so he left. 10 days later I called because I hadn't receive the money back. They said it would take 7-10 business day. I explained that the day was currently 7 business days from the initial claim. She said to check back after 10 business days. 4 days later (2 weeks after I cancelled my appointment) I stilled hadn't received the money. I called to ask about it and they said that both the initial rep I talked to and the one I talked to after 7 business days never cancelled the appointment and it was still open. The gentleman then explain that he finally properly cancelled the appointment and it unfortunately reset the clock on my refund and it would be another 7-10 business days. When I said that was unacceptable, they said they expedited it to 3-5 business days, which means it would be a total of at least 19 days to get my $50 back. This is ridiculous. Asurion is more than happy to quickly take your money, but you will have to fight like hell if you expect to get it back. Horrible customer service at a company where it seems that no one know what they're doing. I will never use this company again and am considering dropping Verizon if they continue to use Asurion."

"Quick & easy, but automated system could use some revamping.",Ashley S.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-07-26T15:36:26.000Z,,"The process was pretty simple. The most challenging part was actually getting through the initial claim submission part. The screen on my phone was completely shattered, but i was able to use it with my car to make calls and listen to notifications, and I don't have a working computer to submit online. The main issue was that i was either asked to type or say information and when neither worked, i would get hung up on rather than be transferred to a person who could help me. I had to go to my verizon store and have them help me complete the initial claim, but after that everything went very smoothly. Claim was a little cheaper than expected, and I got my product quickly. Also liked that I got a tracking number for the return, so I could make sure my damaged phone reached the destination (considering the steep charges for either not returning on time or at all). Even with the problems I encountered, I'd still recommend."

I got my replacement device next day and was back to communicating with friends and family. My returned device got there quickly and for the first time ever I didn't have to stress about paying a non-return fee because it didn't get received properly by the warehouse. The only issue I had was I am in Alaska with no one I really know and the process required a phone to complete which was kind of my issue. I don't know if there are easier ways but I would, going forward, assume that if someone is filing a replacement claim on a mobile phone that chances are they don't have a phone to communicate with. Maybe provide an additional option for verifying claims."

I asked to swap it out and they would not and claimed it was under ATT after bouncing back and forth between the two companies three times, Asurion just hung up on me.

When my refurbished replacements came in the mail and had difficulties (first one the flash did not work, the second was having software issues) Asurion rapidly switched them out for me. They even helped put me in touch with AppleCare for a while, which historically has been impossible if you don't have apple care (which I do not). The whole process took about two weeks, but through each step I felt like they were actively trying their best to solve my problem. I understand when things can't always be right the first time, what matters is how you respond in the face of mistake/failure/change in expectations, in this Asurion excelled."

Look into Alternate Options for Insurance,TeriLeigh Anderson,,US,1 review,2017-06-22T20:02:19.000Z,,"In one and a half hours I talked to 6 different reps.  I was hung up on twice and erroneously redirected to AT&T once. I was ultimately told that my claim was denied because the policy had been cancelled on their end.  I had not received notice of this cancellation and was told that it was on AT&T to notify me.  When I asked if I purchased a new device and purchased a new policy to cover the new device I was once again redirected to AT&T.  AT&T could not answer that question because it is an Asurion who cancelled my original policy, and Asurion would not say anything other than that the policy is not based on the device but the telephone number associated with the policy.  By the end of this experience I was extremely frustrated and still phoneless with no answer to my question."

after paying my $150 deductible I wish I would have just upgraded,Miranda O,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-06-18T04:30:31.000Z,,"after paying my $150 deductible I wish I had never made my insurance claim on my phone and just upgraded to a new one like I ended up doing plus losing $150. So the phone I sent back I received the refurbish phone  the next day.  Activated it  restored it with all my contacts and emails from work. (Back story)I run a business and I have to transfer my phone to my personal phone multiple times during the day and at the close of each day so a working phone that I pay a lot of money for every month is extremely important. Well no more than 3 days later the phone would no longer respond. I had issues with it from day one but I didn't lose access to it till day 3. I couldn't  open the home screen, type my password in, nothing..the touch screen was  unresponsive . they called it touch  disease. Well I called again to make a second claim and get another phone. Well the lady I was speaking to wouldn't send me a another phone because I couldn't get into my settings in my phone to manually reset the phone. So she told me I would have to call back and they would  ""monitor it"" take notes in the system. I would have to call back tomorrow.  I've had this phone for less than 4 days and it doesn't work.... pretty upset at this point can't answer business calls or anything. I call back the next day.... the lady I was speaking with told me the only way I could make a second claim is if the trouble shoot it and found problems. So I told her trouble shoot it! Here's the kicker she told me I would have to  manually do this by going to my settings. Again I told the lady I HAVE NO ACCESS TO MY PHONE I CANT GET TO SETTINGS. IT HAS TOUCH DISEASE. Then she proceeds with an  attitude and ask me to hold the power button and lock button down so it will do a reset. So again after it resets I tell her for the 100th time I still can't access my phone. The touch screen is  unresponsive. then she  proceeds to tell me she'll send me a new phone but if the phone comes back ""working"" there will be a lawsuit against me for a faulty claim. I know you have polices and you have to run a business as well but I think after the 2 second day of calling you would have kinder words to say to someone. So finally I get another  refurbished phone. Well they good news is i didn't even have to back this phone up with all my personal data cause it wouldn't even connect to service. I spent over 2 hours trying to access service before I finally when up to Verizon and after they  fidgeted with it  for over an 1hr they told me there was something wrong with the phone to do an  Insurance claim on it. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDIDING ME. So Verizon kindly let me use there phone to call   asurion since mine didn't work again. They same issues again they didn't bevelie the phone they sent me wasn't working they ask me if I had taken it to my provider so they could try and make it work. I again  explaining to her that I had done all these things I even let her talk to the man at Verizon who was helping me and she told me they would send out a another phone but I wouldnt  receive the phone for four days because of  memorial day weekend. I wouldn't get the phone till Tuesday's. ( memorial day was on Monday) now they were nice enough to up  Grade me to a  BRAND new version ( rather than refurbished) then mine was originally but not the newest model available. I told her I couldn't wait that long I run a buiness i need a phone at least by tomorrow. I been without a working phone for almost a week now an now your telling me it will be another 4 days? there is much more I could say but this has already went on for to long. I ended up just upgrading to a new phone so i could have a Working phone in the end. I'm not rating them bad because things do happen and you always can't help it but I feel they could have prevent a lot of this and maybe done a little more in the end to get me a  temporary phone through Verizon...so Waiting 4 days for a phone wouldnt be so bad."

I had already sent my damaged one(badly cracked screen) to them by the time I started having problems with the ""new"" tablet. I took it to my Verizon store & they confirmed my suspicions that it was a repaired tablet from someone else. I will be reading  & the screen will suddenly turn black. I will be looking something up on internet & it will jump to something completely different. At times I have to really jab it to get it to respond.

Clumsy and very slow claim process,PAUL R,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2017-06-02T17:38:34.000Z,,"We have been using Asurion for several years. The process used to be quite quick and painless, but the last few times I've had to get replacements for the kids phones it has involved a clumsy affidavit process that usually extends things a day or two. Replacing a phone with Asurion now takes at least one or two days before a replacement device is even shipped. When we upgrade to new devices we will be exploring other insurance options that have a more streamlined claim process."

The service was fine,Marla Mooney,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2017-05-25T12:43:08.000Z,,"The service was fine. I'm grateful that I have the insurance to make this service possible. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that it cost $200 to replace my phone.  I am completely aware that I have a very expensive phone. I pay every month for my insurance. I pay for it BECAUSE I know that I have an expensive phone. When my phone initially broke, I had so much anxiety because I was worried about paying what I thought would be the $100 deductible! My heart dropped when I learned it would be $200. I considered not repairing it. But I have 3 very little babies and I need to have access to a phone. We live on such a tight budget, and we had to severely sacrifice that week to pay $200. That is appalling."

I contacted Asurion and explained that I needed a bigger (longer) padded envelope and I was told they would mail one to us.  When I received it it was the same size. I ended up buying a padded envelope from my local post office and taping the prepaid information to it. It almost didn't make it within our 15 day deadline.

Poor Service,Kelly Maddock,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-05-12T00:49:55.000Z,,"Hello,This is the 2nd time filing a claim in 1 year for a faulty phone which is fine, I get that technology breaks. But both times I filed I have to contact 2-3 times to get it right. This time I contacted Monday they said they would be sending me a phone and it would not be a problem. Great! I have been checking my emails and nothing has came so I called them and a claim has not been started and I have to wait another 2 to 3 days to receive the phone, if it happens.The first time it happened I had to contact them three times, maybe more it was a year ago. The first they said they would be sending me a Phone immediately , I got an empty box to send back my phone to get looked at and refurbished then they'd send it back to me so I was would be left without a phone for two weeks or so. Then I contacted and they said they would be sending me a phone but they ended up charging me the entire price for a brand new phone. Had to contact again finally to get a Supervisor who was great and got it covered but it should not take more than once each time to get it right. I understand mistakes happen but it's happened to me five times already, and did nothing for an apology as I should of had the new phone by now and there is not a way to expedite they said.No sincerity, I get it can be hard talking to customers all day but they need to remember that this is our situatuation too and it's frustrating especially when I have to keep contacting.I wish there were another insurance company I could use if I ever have to do this again."

However, the form took less than 3 minutes to fill out and my phone DID come the next day. I was even able to mail my old phone back via USPS by dropping it off at the nearest mailbox. Since Asurion sent me a prepaid return envelope the process was no hassle. I almost didn't make the claim but I am glad I did.      As for the return service, my old phone was easy to track. I followed the updates up until it made it to its destination. Thanks for insurance. Although it was only a 180 dollar phone I only had to pay 50 dollars for a replacement and even got an upgraded version because the older version was no longer available.      The craziest part about it is that I didn't have to speak to anyone to claim the insurance. It was that easy. I highly recommend this company."

Insurance on V20 Cell Phone,MACHELLE D,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-04-12T15:03:01.000Z,,I was in a terrible four car pile-up and my phone was slammed against the dash. Fortunately I did have insurance. The only bad thing was that I was injured so badly that I did not have the capability to go into the place I purchased the telephone to have my information transferred over to my new phone. So are Sharon kept calling me and bothering me about returning my damaged device and I could not seem to get them to understand that I wanted to but I was injured and was undergoing surgery. So other than them not giving me more time without constantly calling me I would say that I'm very pleased with the service I received.

I had my replacement phone within 48 hours of submitting my claim.  The instructions were easy and all of my data transferred to my new phone in a snap.My only complaint is the $199.00 deductible.  I have been paying my monthly fee for at least five years without a claim.  The phone in question was about five months from being paid off via Verizon.

I was stuck without out a phone 1200 miles from home and needed to manage my company from away. They did everything they'd promised without a hitch. Too bad the new phone couldn't be shipped to my cellular carrier as I had no solid address to receive my package at, or as an alternative, to bad I couldn't pick up a new phone in store. With some creativity I was able to have it shipped to a neighbors address but was hesitant about the process. Again, no fault of asurion but a little difficult to do from away from home."

Great customer service,JACKY H,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-03-12T02:09:31.000Z,,"After my screen was craked I had two options, replacing my screen for 79.99 deductible or paying 149.99 for a whole phone replacement. After some doubts I went for the whole phone. I received it right away the next morning, the only bad thing is that the screen was messed up and I had to call to let them know, right away they apologized and offered to send me another one the next morning. My second replacement worked for a couple of days before it started to have problems so I called them again! After a couple of minutes on the phone I was offered a newer model with more memory for the inconvenience ( i had an iphone 6 plus). After all this refurbished phones I received I wasn't so hopeful of the phone coming my way. It was a nice surprise to actually receive a brand new 6 S plus. I got to say that even thou my experience wasn't the smothest it wasn't the worst either. I guess it's good to know that at the end of the day their customer service made upnfor the frustration I had. Yes I would recommend Assurion to everyone!"

One call, 5 mins, and the next day I had a brand new factory replacement of the latest version of the phone.  I've carried insurance on the phones for many years and never had a claim, but still feel it was a good value as the lost phone was less than a year old and would have been an expensive replacement."

The issue is we claimed insurance on a 32GB phone and received only a 16GB phone, so applications that were kept previously had to be deleted and pictures moved to the computer as this phone doesn't take a SD Card for more space. I think that all aspects should be the same and if not then notice should be given. Other than that, it was a super easy process and we were satisfied."

Teenagers with a $600 phone is a problem in the first place.  They gave us a new phone after cracking the screen.  Then another time we had a cracked screen and then the phone malfunctioned as well.  The replaced the phone completely.  Both of the rebuilt phones looked and performed like they were brand new.  Apple is really the only problem.  Their process for turning off the ""find your phone feature"" is a joke.  How might you do this if your phone is malfunctioning?  Well, it's a several day process, which seems crazy and way over the top on what it should be to do.  All in all, Asurion is a great company and offer a great product.  If you have teens, I would definitely get the insurance.  For sure if you have boy teens."

On my original claim I had a replacement phone the next day!  The phone looked brand new,  but after a few days it wouldn't hold as good a charge as my original phone and seemed to get warm.  I call customer service at Asurion to see if I needed to change a setting or something.  The. Representative said I would have a Brand new phone the next day.  I argued and told her I  thought it had to just be something simple.  Nope I had a new in the box phone The next day. Now who does that?  Most people you deal with now would just give you the run around until you quit bothering them. I have always been sceptical of cell phone insurance,  no longer.

The replacement phone arrived very quickly. The transfer of data as described in the booklet was not so easy and did not work. Had to take my phone into Verizon for transfer. A prepaid envelope was supplied for return of old phone. The $150 deductable seems high for a phone that can be bought new for $500. A good used S7 could be bought for $250. One thing that puzzles me is the charge on my card indicates it is an out of the country transfer? Somewhat concerned with that transaction.

When I went to file my claim, the only choice was to order a black iPad Air 2 which is not what I wanted. I believe that they CAN offer different colors as it appeared that way on their website but I was not given a choice. Apple still manufactures and sells the white one but Asurion did not offer it. Now, I have so many apps that keep crashing on me and poor cell service (data signal/strength) for web usage even with 5 bars. In addition, they're website was down several times when I tried to go online and finish my claim."

Thankfully I saved all the content in my old phoeto the Verizon Cloud and was able to repopulate my new phone with everything except my speed dial settings.  I did find it quite unsatisfactory the my ""Everything"" Insurance failed to cover the 64Gb Mini SD Card and my Otter Box protective case.

Could improve,GABRIEL V,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-01-18T14:28:34.000Z,,The pros: your online agents are very helpful and professional. Took care of thing quickly and are knowledgeable. The cons: the online experience was not good. The site quit twice while imputing critical input steps.  Having to start over even quitting while agent was online. Not knowing if your order went through. If you needed to correct the address it would not allow changes. The agent said phone would be delivered overnight. I rearranged work schedule to receive phone since signature was required. The phone took 3 days to arrive. Not as promised by agent. Once phone arrived the packaging was poor. The SIM card was not noticeable and could have been tossed with  poor Packaging content.  There is room for improvement. Instructions are poor.

The reason for only three stars is because I never received confirmation that my damaged phone was received in time by Asurion, and more importantly, that I properly followed the instructions for what to do on the damaged phone before returning it. Considering that Asurion stated I could be charged upwards of $300 if the instructions were not properly followed, I would have GREATLY appreciated a simple email confirming they received the damaged phone within the specified time frame, and that all instructions were properly followed."

Service was very fast & my replacement device seems to work just like a brand new one. The only hiccup I had was that the wrong size of SIM card was sent with my replacement. Asurion offered to overnight me the correct SIM card or I could go to a corporate Verizon store for a free one. Since I live about 45 minutes from a corporate store & I had already waited a couple of days for the replacement (since the accident happened on the weekend) I chose to pay the $10 for a new SIM card from my local Verizon store. Still better than paying for a brand new phone since I was not upgrade eligible.

New device arrived exactly when I had hoped.Their instructions were clear and I had no problems initiating the new device.

I wasn't too worried until I ran my thumb against my edge (Galaxy S7 Edge) and almost sliced my thumb. Realized I needed a new phone, asap. Went home, filled out the online forms, signed the paperwork, sent it all in, paid the fee and by 3 the next day, I had a phone in my front porch. Other than an issue with a bad Sim card, I had it up and running by the end of the evening and now have a perfectly working phone. It was even an updated version of my old one.Couldn't be happier. So worth the monthly fee and the co-pay. Will never go without insurance, it's actually not worth it, financially, to risk something happening to my phone."

I was going to send the new phone they sent me back,  get my money back,  and go back to my old phone.  It stunk that they wouldn't turn my old phone back on until they received the new phone they sent me that didn't work. So I would have had to have waited up to two weeks before I could have a cell phone and since I use my cell phone for work that was not an option. Finally I got a great representative who said to send my replacement back and they send me a new one and because they didn't have my brand and stock I got an upgraded phone and that was great.

New phone/ NO insurance,EDWARD A,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2017-01-06T17:20:04.000Z,,"So, I have a galaxy s6 with Otterbox. Phone gets dropped & screen broken, so I file a claim & pay the deductible to get a refurbished one. Except the $150, was hassle-free. Replacement (in otterbox) dropped a few months later...exact same outcome. When filing second claim, I have to jump through a few more hoops, but I get it...FRAUD! So I pay another $150 (total of $300 now plus monthly insurance plan) and was happily surprised when the replacement came it was a NEW phone not refurbished. Did a little happy dance, until the letter came the next day basically saying, ""we've done all we can with you, you now have no insurance""....of course they're not charging me and I did get A NEW replacement,  but dang to drop a loyal customer that way that doesn't have a history of phone accidents.

Would cycle on and off and would do nothing else.  Put in the claim, paid the $149, told the phone would be at house the next day, two extra days later it showed up.  I don't believe that we had the phone for 30 days before it started to cycle through the on/off all the time.  Son took to the local store and they could not figure out what was wrong.  I believe this phone is a lemon.  Company agreed to send a new phone out to arrive the next day (which it did).  Son says that the screen is too sensitive when he types (lots of doubles) he took it to the store and they said there was nothing that could be done about it.

Very Easy.. Had replacement phone next day!,LISA S,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-12-27T20:26:13.000Z,,I purchased the insurance for my son's phone and within a few months he dropped the phone and cracked the screen.  I didn't want to hassle with the insurance claim because I thought it would take a lot of paperwork and follow up and didn't really have time.  I also wanted to make my son wait since I told him to use a case on the phone and he didn't.  So Christmas was getting close and I finally decided to see what needed to be done.  It took me about 10 minutes to complete the information and I was done.  Phone arrived on a Saturday and my son had no problems moving his info from one phone to the other.

Best Thing To Have - Quick Turnaround - Glad I Had It!!!,GridIron Productions,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-12-25T03:22:37.000Z,,My phone was stolen while at McDonalds.  I attempted to call it as well as track it but the thieves were smart enough to shut it off right away so that didn't work.  It is a $600 phone(Android Turbo - LOVE  IT) so they knew it is worth something.  I logged onto Verizon and suspended service to prevent the thieves from using the device.  When I got home I reported it stolen on the Asurion website and I had my replacement phone the next day.  My deductible was $150 due to the cost of the phone but figure again to buy a new one is over $600 - can't beat that!

Good service,Hans Sitarz,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-11-30T23:39:17.521Z,,"Basically good service but would recommend taking another look at the claim filing process for the consumer.  Presently it is not altogether user-friendly or intuitive.Also, limitation of two claims per year should be re-evaluated.  Sometimes there might be extenuating circumstances surrounding a second claim that could allow for an exception to the two claims per year limitation.In my case, the second claim was the result of a mishap that occurred in the midst of a personal health crisis.  It would be nice if one could have a case reviewed through personal, live contact between the claimant and Asurion to see if an exception might be warranted, a sort of appeal process.Because of the two claim limit, my smartphone now is not covered and will not be until March 2017.  A dissatisfying situation.Thank you for listening."

Had difficulty getting Verizon to transfer data from old phone to new phone; hence, it took some extra time to return old phone in postage-paid mailer that came with new phone.  Only issue was I received an email alert saying my iPhone hadn't had the ""find my Iphone"" feature deactivated and threatened me with a fine of up to $500.  Called Asurion, they said the phone was fine and that those emails are ""automatically generated by computer"".  What???  Why in God's name would Asurion send such an email if it weren't true?  That was definitely not cool, not at all.  Nevertheless, experience was positive."

When my replacement arrived after I paid the deductible on insurance, I realized the first day there was a problem with the phone but I was glad to have one so I ignored the problems with it.  Well by the end of the week I was really fed up with the issues and carried it into the Verizon store.  I started telling the person at Verizon and my phone started messing up while he was looking at it.  He immediately called and reported the problems and told me my replacement phone would be here the next day which was Saturday.  It was delivered that day like he said it would be, I am very pleased with the service."

Is that really worth 10 bucks a month? It was this time. No issues with Asurion, but next time, I am going with a carrier that actually replaces the device instead of making me pay for the device using a deductible. I personally believe that is not a company I want to work with and as soon as my contract expires, I will be moving elsewhere. This is not to knock Asurion, their services were excellent, we received the phone next day! The Asurion folks are pleasant to work with!"

Ease of use and minimum of red tape.,BRUCE O,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2016-10-23T23:52:38.000Z,,"Whenever I purchase insurance of any kind, I realize the array of providers starts at the bottom and rises to the top where a select few companies provide stellar service at reasonable rates. My research and due diligence over the years has saved me thousands (if not much more) of dollars and saved me  exasperation, frustration, angst, etc. My recent several claims  with Assurion regarding lost and stolen phones lead me to believe Assurion is in such company. Most notable is their efficiency, their equity, and their respect for my time while providing reliable and competent service. I do highly recommend based on my experiences thus far."

First 2 times no one was willing to help and it was going to be a week before my phone replacement would be available.  Finally after my boyfriend called on my behalf and talked with a manager they were able to get me a new phone and an upgraded phone S7, delivered to me within 5 business days for the same price as my current replacement an S5.  He also emailed a letter to the customer service department about what an inconvenience this whole process was to finally get a resolution 3rd time around.  A Manager called us the following day after reading the email and sent us a $50 gift card for our inconvience.  Did not start off with good customer service but by the end I guess it all worked out."

Unfortunately, that phone was not able to sych up and so that phone was returned and the company sent her an IPhone 6 at no additional charge. My high school senior has always been very responsible with her phone and I really felt that the company worked with us to get her back on track almost immediately. Thanks so much Asurion!"

When finally the latest greatest phone received worked. The down side was that my son was without a phone for over a week and could not receive any of his business calls.  Perhaps prior to sending out equipment you test it to insure it is working properly. This would save a lot of time and inconvenience to the customer.  You should be making some amends for the less than stellar experience."

I made the mistake of ordering a Galaxy S6 edge for my wife, rather than a Galaxy S6 Edge PLUS.  Needless to say, she was less than impressed with the small screen on the replacement phone that arrived the next day.  Rather than make me pay a SECOND deductible for the second phone, your representative just went ahead and sent the correct replacement phone, before I'd returned the wrong one.  Really really great job folks!"

Disgraceful,NICHOLE S,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-10-20T02:53:40.000Z,,"Not only had I paid my monthly charge to have the insurance, but was told 2 different amounts that I had to pay for a replacement. Which of course turned out to be the most expensive. Then they send me a broken phone first. Seriously broken so they state that they inspect these handsets?  How did they miss the fact that there was no way to speak on the phone  without it on speaker?  Wouldn't that be one of the first things. Then they send me another and had I not already had 2 phones set up for work twice I would be returning this one too.   They have a monopoly though and I can't choose who my insurance is so they can treat customers like crap."

I'll Be Keeping My Phone Insurance Active FOR SURE Now!,McKenzie R. ,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-10-16T21:06:36.000Z,,"I had recently upgraded my iPhone with Verizon to the new SE and about 3 days later, the worst happened. I was using the restroom before leaving for a 3 day outdoor trip when my brand new phone slipped out of my pocket and into the toilet bowl. Shocked and panicked, I froze for a good 2-3 seconds before grabbing the bubbling iPhone. After 3.5 days of sitting in rice, the phone would not turn on or connect to power, upon which I had it looked at and it was concluded that the water damage was unfixable. Awesome. At this point I did not know what was going to be my situation and so walking back into Verizon in tears, they looked up my account and gave me the information for the insurance company. Asurion did an amazing job; all of the directions and requirements for turning in a broken phone were clear and concise, their customer support via phone call was phenomenal with knowledgable employees on the other line, and the process was so quick and effortless that I would never think twice about NOT having phone insurance. Thanks again Asurion!"

They literally get you a replacement phone immediately. My disappointment is I had severe issues with the first replacement phone they sent me. The software must have had a glitch or virus. It was like the phone was possessed.  They immediately sent me a replacement phone. This time I had trouble downloading my information from the cloud because the version was so old. Now my issue is when I try to answer a call, it doesn't allow me to swipe and I keep missing calls.  Also, since I downloaded IOS 10, many of my apps crash.  Not happy.

Worst experience,JENNIE C,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-10-13T04:34:09.000Z,,"It's the worst experience to be able to get a phone that works after spending $149.00  2 different times ... Refurbished phones is all you get, and then you get the run around... Never getting a working phone... This phone dose the same thing.. one wonders if paying insurance for a contracted term and yet I still had to pay $149.00 to get a refurbished phone .. pretty ridiculous.. and now they won't insure me after 2 claims... I don't get it.."

Total it cost me $469 b/c deductible was $199,CUSTOM C,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-10-13T04:30:21.000Z,,I ended up paying more than the phones value at the time I used the insurance. I won't keep insurance on a phone for more than 12 months from now on. $11/mo X 24 months plus $199. $469 all together to replace phone worth $300. Not good. As phone ages and premiums are paid deductibles should decrease.

Phone stolen,JACQUELYN R,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2016-10-13T02:32:46.000Z,,"I am always little leery about ""insurances"" but since the phone was for my 16 year old son I thought it a good idea.  He was at a store when his phone was stolen, I did all the necessary and easy paperwork and received the phone within 24 hours, visited the local Verizon store once I received it and they set it up for me very quickly.  I was impressed."

Replaced Phone,LINDA E,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,7 reviews,2016-10-13T00:25:49.000Z,,"It was a bit cumbersome to fill out the form. At first Verizon told me to go to the store and it would be replaced. Not true! They said they did not replace phones and did not have this model. While I was there, I had Verizon call Asurion to request a new phone. I had completed an application on line (so I thought) but there was another half of hour of questions. It cost $149 to replace the phone which was overheating (remind you of the Samsung 7) through no fault of mine.They did send another phone 2 days later (because it was a week-end) and I spent about an hour at the Verizon store getting it to work. When I went outside, I could not make a call. They accused me of doing something to it (which I did not). The sim card Verizon used was bad and they replaced it. Also, the phone was not fully charged and I did not realize that so that was another complication. I was going to someplace that I had never been and I had no phone and no GPS (except that I also travel with a Tom Tom and was able to work things out).It took a few days until all my apps were working again although I still have trouble connecting my phone to the car blue tooth.However, all in all, not having to spend $600 on another phone makes it worthwhile.Also, I have stopped using a case and the phone stays cool."
