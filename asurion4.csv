More specifically, the phone had to remain plugged in to an outlet to remain ""on"".  Even though it displayed 100% charged, it would power off within one minute after disconnect from the ac outlet.Because reliability of my cell phone is crucial to my position as Chairperson of our local Food Pantry and current medical issues, the replacement phone has been replaced by an upgrade through our Verizon plan.The insurance did provide a much needed bridge, even with it's limitations, from my lost phone to the new phone received through our Verizon plan."

Those had to then be forwarded. Once all that was done, she received her phone promptly. Also, since the phone isn't yet paid for, I'm not happy that the amount she has to pay is so high.

"Speedy service, ridiculous barriers to filing a claim",EWBAITE,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-05-03T13:34:01.000Z,,"Process was smooth and went well after filing the claim. Phone arrived very quickly and service was great. My only complaint is that filing a claim was difficult and frustrating. The instructions required that I turn off ‘Find my iPhone’ which I couldn’t do because my screen was not functional. The claim instructions accounted for this, so I used another device to locate and try to turn it off. It didn’t work because my phone was still online and was not dead. I couldn’t turn it off as the phone was not functional. I removed the phone from my Apple ID and went through the series of required steps multiple times, but nothing worked. The claim form would not allow me to file a claim until Find my Phone was shut off, but no instructions or steps provided how exactly to do this for a phone that was still online and couldn’t be shut off. After trying it on two successive evenings and searching through every instruction and help and FAQ item so could find I finally called Apple and was walked through different instructions on how to wipe the phone entirely. This solved the problem, and I was able to submit a claim form after two days of trying. All went well from there and my replacement arrived the next day. However, the claim process was ridiculously frustrating because the instructions did not account for my situation - which cannot be uncommon amongst folks with a broken phone. Please update your claim instructions to explain the alternate steps needed to wipe a phone that cannot be removed from find my phone — OR, remove this as a requirement to file a claim, as the final instructions I received with the new phone stated again to turn off Find my Phone before I sent in the old device. Which tells me that the step could have been completed after the claim filing instead of as an impediment to filing a claim to begin with."

Need to make it easier to talk to a live person.,Lisa B,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-05-02T10:06:21.000Z,,Need to make it easier to talk to a person.  My daughter had lost her phone then found it about an hour after I contacted Asurion. I  called to cancel the claim and you have to enter a number that you are calling about. Upon entering the number the only options were to hear the status of the claim or make a claim all automated.  I tried several times to reach a person I eventually got a person. My claim got canceled before the new device was on it's way but it still shipped and we had to find time to ship it back. Quick service though and easy to make the claim just not that easy to cancel.

I got ripped off.,Annette Townsley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2019-05-01T14:44:04.000Z,,"I bought an ""extended warranty plan"" from Assurion for my food processor at Walmart. I was told that it was good for two years and that it would cover my food processor after the manufacturer's warranty had expired. My manufacturer's warranty was two years, so I understood that I would end up with four years of coverage. -- WRONG. The coverage from Assurion STARTS when you purchase your product -- since my product already had a two year manufacturer's warranty, I was ripped off and sold a worthless warranty, and neither Walmart or Assurion,(when I called to register my warranty) bothered to tell me this. When I called - two and a half months after the warranty expired -- to file a claim, then they told me that it started on the date of purchase, and that I had bought a worthless warranty and refused to do anything about my broken product. So for my experience, this is a rip off."

Phone seemed to be working fine but discovered the next day that not all functions were working. Called back that day and they suggested just replacing my phone. I agreed and they said it would arrive in 1-3 business days. It arrived the NEXT day! Called them back to assist me in moving data from old phone to new phone. They were very helpful and I had an easy transition. Very pleased with my experience.

Although I changed the shipping name and address, 1) the system wouldn’t allow me to enter a room number and 2) despite changing the ship to name, and it showing her name on the confirmation, the Fed Ex label was addressed to my husband. The hotel had been warned to hold the package for her, and they almost returned it because my husband wasn’t listed as a guest."

They give you limited options as answers to pick from and if you aren't quite sure which one is the best to explain your situation it can cause the claim to be denied. It can be rectified but it is a hassle.

In all honesty the only thing that presented some challenges was passwords and touch ID.  Don't know why not all them transfer and it might be the website and not the phone.

They said they would overnight a new one. It didn't come. I had paid them the deductable too. They told me I had to complete paperwork that would be reviewed in 3 hours. I completed it and got an email 13 hours later requesting more information they already had. I called and they asked me to verify information they already had and asking me questions about my past. They said would get a tracking number in a couple of hours, which I never got. I called in and the phone system gave me a tracking number. Hope the phone is programmed correctly. If it comes correct, it will be almost a week before I get my replacement that should have come in 1-2 days. I have had insurance with them for years, and this is the service I get."

I wasnt aware that the phone would be…,Reagan,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-04-16T18:56:19.000Z,,I wasnt aware that the phone would be refurbished and wish I would of been told before finishing the claim. I was mad at first but then looked at it online and it says it clearly right there but I still wish I would have been warned since the first phone that was sent to me wouldn't hold a charge so I had to call and have another replacement sent (free of charge but still not cool) I was told that insurance doesnt cover anything internal only for things like breaks and it being stolen so why did I receive a phone that wouldn't charge if the only issue should have been external? That's why they would have double checked that a refurbished device is ok before finalizing bc honestly if I would have known I would have just upgraded for a new device.other then that customer service was very polite and the phones were received the very next day

My replacement phone came the next day, and I’ve had no problems with it since.

I would not recommend this insurance to…,Allison Garcia ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-04-07T04:27:37.000Z,,"I would not recommend this insurance to anyone. I have been dealing with this company since March 4th and it is now April 6th. My original phone had very minor problems with occasional glitching but I thought since I had the insurance I minds well use it. After charging me to get a screen replacement and that not working, they sent me a phone that after a day or two had even worse issues than the original. After a week of trying to run through tests to prove that this very old refurbished phone was faulty they finally sent me a new one and this phone was even worse. In between all of this I also had issues with phones I sent back getting lost in the mail but then after a very stressful week of talking to usps, finally finding it. Having to call at least 30 times over the last month and reexplain my situation to every person has made this experience more frustrating than you could imagine and not having a functional phone to top it off makes it even worse. I had to drive hours to the closest apple store to now try and fix what they told me was a 5 year old refurbished phone that has been completely unusable due to the out of focus camera, glitching gps, and eventually completely blacked out screen. This company needs to be sending out good quality phones, if not better than what I originally had. Not to mention I am out hundreds of dollars trying to fix problems with this new phone just to have something remotely close to what I started with. I am highly disappointed and refuse to seek help through this company ever again."

3 Claims 0 Phones,Renee White,,US,1 review,2019-04-05T20:29:31.000Z,,On March 31st I submitted a claim with Asurion for my Apple device with ATT. The rep documented the shipping address wrong and the claim was canceled. The second claim was back ordered and never received. When I called to check the status the representative had no answer for me as to why the device was not shipped. They assured me that they were giving me an Iphone XS but then changed it to the X. The people were very rude and kept giving me false delievery dates. Today is now April 5th and I am still without a phone. I have a child in school and they have no way to contact me because I am left without a phone. This isn't the half of my anger with this company because of their lack of communication. ATT needs to find a new 3rd Party because they are never getting my business again after this.

Then, it ripped and discolored our clothes. It ruined lots of my clothes, ripping out many jackets along with pajamas . I complained about it calling them hundreds of time. They were very mean and disrespectful to me. They did not want to get me a new one, although I showed the receipt along with the warranty to them emailing them everything. Moreover, I called them after that saying that they received. They agreed that they have it but do not wanna get me a new dryer.I mailed them the receipt seven times. The replied to me saying literally “ I do not care about you”. How disrespectful is that ? Would never buy anything from this awful horrible company again.

I sent my phone off to get a very tiny crack,JESSICA C,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-04-04T03:14:22.000Z,,I sent my phone off to get a very tiny crack towards the top of my iPhone fixed. They sent it back not fixed. Then I plugged it in and turned it on to find that my home button was broken. I called and they told me that they never touched it but plugged it in and it was showing errors so they just sent it back to me. So I had to spend $125 to get a replacement phone. I tried to explain to a couple different people that this wasn’t a problem when I sent it in. They told me there was nothing they would do for me. So I was not a happy customer. However I got my replacement phone the next day. I think they broke my phone and just shipped it back to me to be honest.

Asurion's Customer Service is HORRIBLE,Jennifer Collier,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2019-04-04T02:57:09.000Z,,"Claim last Wednesday 3/27 around 5pm. Technically I should have had a phone 3/28 Thursday. I gave it until 3/29 before I started to get worried. Its now 4/3/19 and I have no phone, no tracking number. I have spoken with a different rep on Friday, Monday, twice on Tuesday and now again tonight. I continue to be given the run around. Everyday I am told my replacement phone will arrive the next day, nothing. Yesterday I was told it was being processed manually and would be 3 to 5 business days Wait? WHAT? Why? I was told I would get an email with my tracking number... no email. I called tonight and she tells me again that it will ship tomorrow? Why isn't someone putting the phone in the box and making sure that it goes next day air? You have had my $100 co-pay for a week now, I need a phone. To top it off, after I asked to speak to a supervisor this evening, she refused after keeping me on hold for 15 minutes and when I stated again that I asked to speak to a supervisor directly myself and she hung up on me. NOT COOL Asurion. I want a refund, I can go buy a new phone."

This is my second review now.,Alex,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2019-04-03T19:57:30.000Z,,"This is my second review now.. i have been waiting for a replacement device for over a month now. My phone got stolen so Asurion sent me a refurbished device, this device malfunctions on the daily: dropped calls, slow data, and texts sometimes will not send. I have called them almost 20 times now for the new device to get shipped out and everytime they tell me the same thing, “Alex, your device is on the way and should be there between 2-3 business days. We apologize for the inconvenience and know how important your phone is to you”. No you don’t!! If you did I would have have my replacement device by now. And I’m sure they will comment on this review telling me they want to look further into the situation and to send them an email or go on their website. Every time I call I ask for the shipping information of the new phone but then they explain they can’t give it to me until the device is shipped.. so then I land in the same spot I was before because the phone never gets shipped out. Let’s see how long this actullay takes for me to receive the phone, it’s already been over month going on two now. Asurion is a pain to deal with, definitely do NOT recommend them to anybody. And what’s even worse is that Asurion is the insurance provider for almost every cellular company so there’s no way out of using them. Someone needs to invest in a phone insurance company, that way were not stuck using Asurion."

First experience with them replacing my…,Michael McGregor,,CA,1 review,2019-04-01T18:50:56.000Z,,"First experience with them replacing my phone was fine, until the replacement abruptly shut down and wouldn't restart. Since then, dealing with Asurion has been nothing but problems. The second replacement sent out was a much older phone that could not be described as a ""comparable device"" in any way other than it was made by the same manufacturer. When this device started to malfunction, I called for yet another replacement, asking for a device more comparable to the phone that was originally covered. They agreed to send a Samsung s7, but there was never any follow up. Several weeks later I called to find out what was going on, only to find out that the latest replacement was cancelled without any explanation or notification. They now refuse to honour the agreement for the Samsung, refused to explain why the replacement was cancelled, why they refuse to honthe previous agreement or explain how the older phone they sent last time is more comparable to my original phone that was covered than the S7. We have yet to see if this defective phone will be replaced or if I'll be charged a replacement fee again."

Great but-Didn’t know there’s a $89 fee to receive same model refurbished phone,Dana C,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-29T11:23:55.000Z,,"Treatment was great, and my phone arrived the next day by noon. I called the number provided and my phone was up and running. You have to return your phone within 4-7 days, I can't remember exactly but you are told when you receive your replacement & by the rep. The replacement is a refurbished phone not new. I had to get the exact model I had for the $89 charge. The only thing I did not realize on my part was the $89 charge to replace my phone & had to provide my credit card to proceed. I thought my coverage was paid for and no deductible was part of the protection. Was told I have a 1 year warranty on replacement phone. I could have updated my phone because I was due for one and send back the replacement but I decided I did not want the expense for a new IPhone. Phone works!"

Worst warranty experience I've ever had,Alex G.,,US,2 reviews,2019-03-27T20:47:13.000Z,,"I bought a pair of headphones about a year ago with this 3 year protection plan and they got damaged about 2 months after I bought them. I sent them in for repair and they fixed the cable and sent them back to me. Something they did in the repair process, or something else that happened to the headphones when they got damaged, changed the sound signature of the headphones significantly making them really bloated in the bass. I even bought the exact same pair from Amazon to compare the brand new ones to the ones that keep getting ""repaired"" and the sound signature issues are immediately obvious. The repeatedly sent me the headphones back saying there's nothing wrong with them and that I should just EQ the extra bass out. Completely unacceptable for a warranty you pair for that is supposed to remedy this exact problem of the headphones being damaged.I had to send in the headphones not once, not twice, but 3 times already and they wanted me to send them in for a 4th time to ""make sure they're beyond repair"". I've said over and over again, the driver in the headphones was damaged and that can't be fixed by changing the cable out. I need reimbursement from the warranty so I can buy a new pair of headphones and I keep getting the runaround."

I even went to Apple and replaced my battery in order to fix my phone, only to find two situations, 1) it got worst, and I had to contact att  2) also, AT&T got my new battery and sent a phone with a poor battery!!   I am just sick about loosing my new battery for this poor excuse of a battery.   It probably being sitting on a shelf for two or so years doing nothing.  Then you send to me as clearly not a perfect functioning phone.   However, complaining is not going to help me, but maybe one I will driving back six hours to apple store for new battery..  and I know these companies love that.. that is why they never complete anything!  So disappointing!  You can tell the difference with a fresh new battery and this old dud that barely gets me through the day... if at all.  Just very happy in long run to finally have a phone working compared to not at all!  ."

I’m giving you a 4 only because I’m wanting to up the chances that this is read.  The phone that I received has a problem with the screen.  At first it works fine but as I used it it gets to the point that its totally spastic.  Again I don’t think that it would be easy to detect unless you spent the day with it.  Most impressive of all was when I called to see what to do your service department was so anxious to still help me even though I hadn’t yet sent the first one back.  I called with the report of the defective phone in the early afternoon and by the next morning I had received the replacement.Thanks for the great service.

Update instructions,Anonymous,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-24T04:38:18.000Z,,"Receiving my new phone was very quick only 2 days. Sending away my old phone was very simple. The only issue I had was that I received a new SIM card with the new phone and the instructions when I tried to activate my new phone online (because my mic on the old phone was the issue) told me I had to go to an AT&T store. When I got there, the associate just took my old SIM card out of my old phone and put it in my new phone, while taking out the new SIM card, so i never had a use for it. I thought it was very unnecessary to have to go into a store for a simple task I could have done at home and there was no point in sending a new SIM card. I think better instructions could prevent issues like this for future people. An instruction sheet with the shipment box on how to remove the SIM card and moving it to the new phone and/or online."

The people at the Verizon store were quite helpful to me but their contacts ts were co fusing g even them.So even with the expensive e insurance it still cost me 200.00 dollars to replace my phone.  I could have gone to Walmart and bought a comparable  android phone for  less than that.

Horrible horrible service,Nick Nelson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-22T21:11:46.000Z,,"Horrible horrible service.  Can't repair my screen on an s9 plus because of its color apparently.  They can't fix a screen on a gold s9. I'm not sure why not but we've been on the phone with them for an hour so far. What a waste.  Verizon really messed up.Edit: after being on the phone for an hour,  and ruining my wife's morning,  we finally got in touch with someone who could help, and he def helped.  And in reguards to the reply from asurion, my phone is gold in color,  still exactly the same as a black or blue S9 plus. It was just a cracked screen.  You should disclose whether or not you can cover it before selling me insurance.  Even though I was eventually helped( they had to give me a new phone because they apparently can't replace the screen on a gold S9 plus) it was a nightmare of an experience.  Maybe something was lost in between Verizon and Asurion, either way it was a disaster.  This review is more about the experience with customer service than the services and final product I recieved. Why Verizon can replace a screen in store is a whole different question."

WORST COMPANY EVER,pc football,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-22T00:07:39.000Z,,"WORST COMPANY EVERI can't believe Verizon would ever support this company and recommend it as an insurance option. I fell and my iPhone 8 bent so bad that the glass shattered on both sides. Was extremely relieved that I had insurance, filed the claim and got a REPLACEMENT within 24 hours. Had no issues with delievery, setup, was willing to pay the price at that point. However, I emphasize REPLACEMENT because all Asurion does is send out CHEAPLY refurbished pieces of junk. Within in days, I had discolorations on my screen, which are a hardware issue that Apple won't touch because the parts used aren't Apple, shortest battery life of all the iPhones I have ever had, and apps that wouldn't load for anything. Call Asurion several times and all they do is read off a script, they never stray from it, saying that the issue is because of the iPhone settings and that they just need to be reset. Even asks if it has been exposed to liquid, because apparently the new waterproof isn't waterproof. Meanwhile, Verizon stands by their claim, ""It is not our problem."" Shorted several hundred dollars and now I have to buy a new iPhone."

I had my replacement phone by the next day. The only thing that caught me off guard was the fee. I ended up having to pay $200 for the replacement instead of a $100 like the Verizon rep told us when we signed up for the replacement plan. I did have a brand new phone but we have been paying $14 a month for 6 years and I have never used it until this year. We have paid almost a $1000 in the past 6 years for this replacement plan. That in itself covered this phone. It was a little disappointing that the fee was so high. I think there should be some type of incentive for people who don't use it often and have paid on it for years.** We actually paid the $14 for 2 phones. The other phone has used the insurance I think once.**

Avoid at all cost,Jordan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-19T18:18:35.000Z,,"I have never once in my life written a bad review, but this company warrants it. They had to send me 3 new devices to get one that worked, and then it only worked for a couple months. The different issues included the phone would not turn on, battery died quick, it would not work often due to not being able to read the SIM card even though I paid to replace it, and lastly nothing worked out of wifi as if I had an ipod touch. I had to call 6 times this last time in order to get them to send me a new phone and tried all troubleshooting with the same issues after. They then accused me of lying saying I did not try the last trouble shooting even though I provided them with the date and time I did it exactly because the lady who did it did not make a note on my record. Also, for this I had to have another phone to call to do the troubleshooting, which was difficult for me. I have not even received this new replacement device because I could not be home due to work when they tried to deliver it and the company puts a limitation on it so I can not go pick it up the first day. Also, when I called to see if they could remove this because I was trying to leave town and needed GPS when not in wifi, the lady was super sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Worst company I have ever dealt with for product and customer service, and I usually give people the benefit of the doubt."

I was extremely impressed at how quickly my device was replaced because it was literally sent overnight. The process to return the old device was easy due to the shipping materials such as tape and return postage label being readily available in the packaging with the new device. I truly believe insurance is very necessary for expensive mobile devices because unexpected mishaps occur that are sometimes beyond the customer's control.

Terrible company,Adriana Bailey,,US,1 review,2019-03-15T20:55:17.000Z,,"I pride myself on sharing positive customer service experiences with any company. This is by far the most negative and foul experience I’ve ever had with a brand, especially with one of their supervisors. I am extremely disappointed that Verizon “America’s most reliable network” is even associated with this company. I have used asurion in the past and never had any problems. I dropped and cracked my phone on March 12, 2019. I called the company to file a claim, the agent set up the process and I was to keep an eye out for an email within 3 hours to print, sign and submit paperwork via fax (optional). I had the rep repeat back my email to me to clarify he had it down correctly. I am traveling, so I assumed me  NOT receiving an email had something to do with that. I’m in Boston, shouldn’t be an issue anyway. I call the company back 24 hours later to check the status of my email, he suggested I check my spam folder, nothing. He finally send 2 of the same email to me immediately following our phone conversation. I use the hotels print/fax services to complete the process. I called again, to clarify the rep received my paperwork. They confirmed and I was to wait another 24 hours to receive another email to give them my financial information to complete the process. I proceed to finish the process and my credit card I initially declined as it kicks it back as a fraud alert, no problem. I confirm with my credit card company that the charge is valid and good to go. When I enter in my information again the company sends an immediate message that I am to call them to complete the payment process. I call AGAIN (this is the 4th phone call to the company) to finish the payment process. The rep tells me I am to wait ANOTHER 24 hours to receive an email to figure out why they won’t accept my payment. At this point I am completely frustrated and overwhelmed. Roughly 32 hours pass by and I have received no email or phone call. I call the a 5th time to figure out just what is going on. The first rep explains he can’t give me details on what’s happening but he can process my payment and I’ll receive my phone Monday the 18th. I explained I will be back home in California, so I will not be having them send phone to my hotel anymore. He explains it will take another 24 hours to process the change. I had him transfer me to a supervisor. The situation gets even better as I can barely understand him/her and requested detailed information about the company policy and procedures. They repeated back to me what I was initially told by the very first rep when I first started my claim. I completely understand and respect these.... but if I have been having these series of unfortunate events by the company whom are clearly NOT abiding by the policy, then what is the point of the policy?!?! Asurion is based in America so why the continuous delay in receiving my phone? He/she explained they don’t have time to call every 24 hours so that’s why they email... okay... cool but you never email me so what in the actual HECK? I have been in the customer service industry for almost 15 years, I love delivering outstanding customer service to all patrons. I am a people person and love interactions with all personalities and love the rewarding feeling of turning a bad situation into a fantastic one. I was hoping this company would understand my unfortunate situation and take care of me. I’m appalled this person is even considered a superior with the company! They had no intention of making the situation right and almost had no care for my disappointment. This is my far the most disgusting and careless company I’ve ever been associated with. I was later told I would be transferred to a superior of theirs, and this person left me on hold with a Spanish speaking recording for over 45 minutes. Wow! The disrespect is real within this company. This is completely outrageous."

But there was a (manufacturing problem with it) which on reality wasn't my problem  because that wasn't my original phone.so you guys referred me to Apple and they didn't want to fix it because you guys voided the warranty by fixing it. I do t know what you guys fixed on that phone but at the end of the day neither Asurion, Verizon or Apple want it to respond for the phone .so I end up buying a new phone direct from Apple .is that I don't think that was good it all."

I submitted an affidavit today that I was assured, by both Verizon and Asurion, will be reviewed within 3 hours. When I called after 3.5 hours, I was told it was 3 business hours. I have screenshots of messages from Asurion and nobody specified 3 business hours. Verizon told me that I could have a new phone tomorrow as long as I completed documents by a certain time tonight. I called Asurion and someone said they were going to transfer me to the resolutions department, but the call disconnected. After I get this phone replaced, I am cancelling my insurance through Verizon and going with an independent insurance operator because this is straight nonsense. z.e.r.o. s.t.a.r.s."

However, I believe the process could have gone smoother if on the very first contact I made to report the lost phone I had been advised to immediately contact AT&T and put the service on suspend.  I was instructed to do this after I downloaded and submitted the completed claim, which was denied until the service was placed on suspend. Needless to say, I had to summit a new claim, which further extended the processing.  In closing, I strongly suggest advising the customer to put service on suspend. Thanks for allowing me to voice my concern."

The return process was also very easy, although I was delayed a little because of the instructions on returning the phone. The instructions said to be sure to remove any batteries, etc, which is impossible in the phone I was returning. I actually went to the Verizon store to ask how to remove the battery, and I was told that it was impossible and to send it back as it was. It would have been more helpful to have known that in the instructions. Otherwise the process is extremely easy. I put the phone into the envelope, and back it went!

Legal gambling/ theft/over inflation/unregulated,TINA H,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-06T12:04:59.000Z,,"I just was posting that the insurance industry is Legalized form of gambling which is designed to take hard working people's incomes with not having actually rendered or tendered a service until you make a claim. Meanwhile we pay a premium for a product that could possibly NEVER have to be used. That being said, had that same amount of money to be taken from you been put into any type of interest bearing account you would be able to tender any  claims to be made two or MORE times over.   Now when you have bad luck, clumsy, or just plain accidents and make three claims within a year's time this company of which you have already paid twice the value of the NEW product, which is now well used, and ONLY worth half of the original price for which they bill you, will cancel your coverage. Quite frankly, because they've now gone from a profit to break even. Although, for two years they have made nothing but profits from you because unless you make a claim, this company will only have to pay for a data entry clerk and postage to send you a statement.   Now assuming that you NEVER make any claims the profit margin for this service per client is GROSSLY inflated!!"

I contacted Asurion and had a new phone the next day.  My on complaint would be that the instructions that came with the phone for set up did not work.  The website was not set up so that you could follow those instructions.  I had to borrow my husbands phone to call in and wait for them to get it set up.  I do wish the website would have worked though, it would have been so much nicer to do it that way than to have to borrow another phone to call in.  I am not sure what someone who did not have access to another phone would have done at that point.  Other than that I have no complaints"

"Good customer service, Terrible technicians!",Julia,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-03-02T17:26:50.000Z,,"While your techs were polite, they made my phone worse. Not only did the home button stop working after they replaced the screen, but the right side sleep button had problems as well.  I had to push it 6-7 times to get the screen to come on.  The “experienced” tech said he had 10 years experience. He said “since I was 12 years old”.   Clearly he needs more years and to be honest about the consequences of having the screen replaced.  Nice guys, terrible technicians."

Everyone I spoke with was professional, polite, and did their part expeditiously. My problem is the devices that I was sent don't work well in the speaker mode which I have to use often due to being hard of hearing and depending on hearing aids. My original Samsung Galaxy S7 worked great in speaker mode. It has been replaced twice and neither replacement has worked well in speaker mode. By the way, I hear the person I'm speaking with fine, but they have difficulty hearing me for a multitude of reasons from clicking sounds to static and my voice fading in and out."

Waste of money,danielle ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-02-27T20:31:31.000Z,,"Asurion has really let us down. I have never been so disappointed with a company like this before. We pay insurance, we pay the deductible and still have a phone that they refuse to fix. Meanwhile I can spend less money at one of these cell phone repair companies that will get the job done but that defeats the purpose of having insurance.Just to be clear your technician did come with the parts but your company told him not to repair the damaged screen because he couldn’t take a picture on said device. He did give me another option with another company to repair it at $70 dollars. The only other option Asurion would provide is a replacement phone at $149. I do not want a refurbished phone just the screen replaced."

Asurion has some issues!!!,Zach Harris,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-02-26T16:28:59.000Z,,"I have a phone with AT&T. My phone was stolen, i have insurance. The hole claim process was easy but didn't live up to it prommises. I gave a number where they could contact me incase there was an issue with my phone claim. They did not do this they instead contact an email that i never was told that they would contact me this way. I had to call AT&T to resolve this issue. The only problem with that is they wanted to send me to Asurion. Then Asurion would send me back to AT&T. Finally i got into contact with the right people, but they wanted for me to refile the claim since it got denied. They informed me the information i sent them did not exist any more. But some how the supervisor read me back all the information that was given to them on the form. After all this its going to take me 4 days to finally get my phone back. They really need to rethink there automated call system, i shouldn't be sent back and forth through at&t and Asurion. My information that was sent originally should be accessible, especially after a couple days. I am not sure who is writing these reviews about this company on this site. But trust me the only reason i recontacted them was because the reviews i read all said that this company was a 3 star at best. A lot of them had poor experience with the online issues and never received there phone and where never contacted. Asurion and AT&T please correct this."

I bit the bullet and called. Like always I had navigate a couple of numbers until I got to Asurion; that is when the happy story began. My claim was handled lighting fast; got my new phone the next. It said refurbushid but it looked brand spanking new. I waited two days to make the transfer just because I had to work and was still able to twist the old phone into working. I went the self tranfer route. It all went smoothly meaning the information upload into the new phone from the cloud and the erasing of the old data until the activation. Even after I found the activation path on the web site per the instructions I was not able to activated it myself, bummer. I was directed by the site to visit the nearest AT&T store. Lucky for me I’m in a very rural area and there are two stores to chose from within 15 minute drive at any time and in california so the weather is not an issue. The very helpful attendant at the store swap the chips and I was on my way. I took my wife to look at the phone selection for her next bithday that was very helpful, I least I was able to multi-task and not dread that I had hit an avoidable dead end.  I would have being able to swap out the SIM card with some good instruction, but in the long run I see why that end step is better left to someone that does it all the time, it avoids damage to a phone by those with little patience.Anyway thank you; that is why you got a great rating for this experience. The old phone is packed amd ready to drop off at the nearest USPS office"

Later in conversation, there was giggling on her end.She told me they don't have any repair specialists in my area...Phoenix (small town..ya know), and therefore rather than pay my $30.00 deductible and have glass the repaired, my only option would be to buy a replacement phone for $200.00. I told her absolutely not ! Its not my problem they don't have anyone nearby in a city of several million people. She then said I needed to lower my voice or she would hang up. I called verizon. Hmmmm...it seems we most certainly DO have repair shops and there is one in my neighborhood to boot !! Thanks to the Verizon sales rep, I will be getting my phone fixed for $30.00. This girl needs to be terminated from her job. I certainly would not want her representing my company."

NOPE!I forgot I had insurance through my provider.I have no local repair facility but was leaving town and there was one local to where I was going.I filed my claim and 2 days later took my phone in.The guy was knowledgeable, professional and very courteous! He was wonderful! I figured a couple hours, so we went for lunch. We didn’t even get through appetizers and got a text my phone was finished. Didn’t even take 30Minutes.I am beyond happy w this service and repair! I’ll def be keeping insurance on my phone, I’d rather deal with Asurion than Apple!Thanks so much for everything!"

No Assurity from Asurion- Faulty Fones,Wooten Epes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-02-18T05:13:06.000Z,,Over the years I have had to make a claim for a lost or damaged iPhone. Ashrion send reconditioned phones promptly within 24 hrs. The problem both of the reconditioned phones failed to work properly. If a second phone is required then they decided to hat they should have 72 hrs to send phone #2 which replaces the phone they failed to recondition properly. And it must be mailed to the billing address. So in my case I had a vacation planned a day after I received the faulty phone. So I just had a trade-in to buy a new phone while traveling. Not an acceptable form of insuring I have an operational phone after several years of premiums.

Can't/won't help me,Dallas ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2019-02-15T19:22:30.000Z,,Can't/won't help me. I sent my phone in to be repaired by Asurion and they found additional damage to my phone that wasn't there when I sent it in. I filed a claim with FedEx but they won't talk to me because they say Asurion is the shipper and is the one who'd they need to talk to you. Asurion tells me no such thing exists and tells me to talk to FedEx. In waiting and wanting to talk to supervisors to help me I have been transferred to FedEx numerous times and also Verizon instead of speaking with a manager at Asurion. Sounds like a crooked scheme. Asurion does not support their customers. I would rate zero if I could.
very dissatisfied customer,Madison Bronson,,US,1 review,2019-02-15T19:05:52.000Z,,"I broke my phone and when I got a loaner phone from sprint they cancelled my complete care while I was in the middle of a claim for my iPhone 10. I received a text saying my complete care was changed on my account and if this was not me to contact this number: 877-699-5798. I then spoke a rep who then transferred me to another rep who said she had added the insurance back onto the plan and it would take 24-48 hours to process the request. I then proceeded to make an appointment online with apple and drove an hour to said appointment. Wherein I was informed that the insurance has not been added back onto my sprint account almost a week before I traveled all that way to get a new phone. So I was then told that the insurance was at that time added back for sure and I'd have to wait another 48 hours and than travel back to the store to pick up a new apple phone for the price of my deductible. I asked the manager why this wasn't done when I called the first time almost a week prior ( to give them plenty of time to change it back even though it was never supposed to be taken off in the first place.) She had no explanation for the severe inconvenience they had caused me. I pay 20 extra dollars a month to have insurance on my phone each month,  just to get jerked around by this company that I'm paying on my sprint bill."

The experience has put me off insurance,Rob Hawes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GB,2 reviews,2019-02-10T04:28:17.000Z,,"The experience has put me off phone insurance. I found staff to be rude, the phone that replaced my brand new phone was second hand with inferior features and is not up to the specs that I need from my phone to perform work related tasks. My new phone also uses a different charger to my original which they hadn't sent, so I called up again and they eventually agreed to send one out. Several days later after being unable to charge my phone, I receive a message from dpd saying they were unable to deliver my parcel because no one was home (very odd given I was working from home that day). So I checked their website and hey presto, they had some how sent my charger to completely the wrong address. So still no charger.  On the day I received the replacement I was told that I could not return the piece of s**t they sent me in exchange for keeping my own phone and having it repaired privately because ""I had opened the box"". I will be using all media platforms to share my dissatisfaction with this company and hopefully save some people from this utterly useless cowboy company."

Starting to not like Asurion,Na S,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,4 reviews,2019-02-08T15:14:35.000Z,,"Starting to not like Asurion. Never sent me my phone case with the phone . Additionally the phone was also a malfunction phone. Similar issue to my prior one. Only had it for a week, and called it back, and they tried to accuse me of messing the phone up “oh you just received it” I don’t have time to keep getting a new phone , as I have important calls . Mind you it’s under 12month warranty. But can’t complete my order until I authorized to charge my card if it has water damage. Mind you if there was water damage , then why is my phone still on?! Then continue to say apple did recalls iPhone 7. So if you knew the issue , why tried to say I messed it up? And they can’t send my phone out til 3 days later because no delivery in my area , when I’ve always had it before? Was sent back and forth to Asurion and then Verizon, and then apple, and back to Asurion app and then to Asurion representatives. Didn’t think completing a claim took 2 days with at least 5 reps. Don’t say it’s warranty when you still trying to accuse and charge people still without even seeing the device. Asurion needs to change their process. I know what they mean know when they say don’t trust “refurbished phones” yet how can a place question you about the malfunctions of a phone when they’re sending you a refurbished phone ?! “But we sent you a NEW phone” no correction it’s refurbished. Not new . Apple even said the model number was under recalled but Asurion said it wasn’t, its new . There’s a discrepancy here."

My daughter’s phone is stolen in the…,Barton Puryear,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2019-02-07T23:03:13.000Z,,"My daughter’s phone is stolen in the morning of 1/18/19 – probably around 9:45. Her backpack is slashed on the subway and someone has taken the phone.I call Verizon to report the phone as stolen the same day, 1/18. Verizon transfers my call to Asurion – where the agent there processes my claim and says that they’ll get a phone out to me right away. I get an email (1/18) indicating, “Your Asurion claim is complete”, and that a shipment is imminent. I then get a UPS tracking number confirming shipment.I later check the shipment status at UPS (probably 1/20), which indicates “Returning to Sender”. I first web chat with someone as Asurion to find out why the phone has been recalled by the sender. The Asurion web chat indicates something about “abuse of the program”. When asked to clarify, he indicated I needed to call in and talk to someone. I called, and reached the adjustor. She indicated that my claim had been denied. I asked why the claim and been denied, and she told me, “I can’t tell you why, read your Terms and Conditions.” Finding it hard to believe an adjustor could not tell me (the insured) why my claim had been denied, she assured me that, not only could she not tell me why my claim had been denied, she explained that she was prevented from doing so by law. When I asked her to cite that law, she declined, and again told me to read the Asurion Terms and Conditions.I called Verizon the next morning, 1/21. The Verizon agent calls Asurion, and tells me that Asurion has denied the claim because the phone service had been suspended. The Verizon agent says if we just re-institute the service and I re-file the claim, there should be no problem. The Verizon agent re-institutes service for the number, and transfers me to Asurion. The Asurion agent takes some information, and indicates that all I need do is fill out an Affidavit & Proof of Loss Statement, and upload that, along with a copy of my identification, all would be good. I printed out the Affidavit, filled it out and uploaded it and a copy of my drivers license to the Asurion site (1/22).On 1/23, I started with Asurion, and spoke to William – who could not offer much in the way of help, so I called Verizon. Verizon indicated at first that the Asurion notes indicated that I’d already received the replacement phone. I assured her that I had not. Verizon called Asurion, and we again spoke to William. William indicated that his notes said that I had cancelled my claim (odd, he made no mention of that the first time we spoke that day). I informed William I had done no such thing. William then transferred me to another operator, who then contacts the adjustor, who again indicates that I’ve been using the claim in some inappropriate way – in what way, she can’t say – but she says they’ll send out a letter explaining why. That was weeks ago – no letter.I post a review on another site – Asurion responds – “Rest Assured”, they say – this is not your standard customer service here at Asurion, and we’ll get to the bottom of this . . . .   After providing some requested information, including the best way to contact me – then nothing.  I’ve never heard from them again.Imagine if your health insurance company denied you an operation – and when asked why they’re denying your claim, they tell you, “I can’t tell you.” That’s the insurance you’re buying with Asurion.P.S. I've read the Terms and Conditions. I cannot for the life of me tell why Asurion has denied my claim. I am a good man, and try to live my life so that I can die proudly, without regret. I haven't tried to scam or trick or take advantage of anyone or anything. Asurion has accused me of exactly that - but they won't tell me why.  I can honestly say, this is unequivocally the worst customer service I've experienced anywhere - ever."

Fix it or give Verizon another provider,Troy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-02-06T18:52:10.000Z,,"You need to figure out the operational issue of your customers being without a phone while their screen is replaced. I don't care if you loan me a very simple phone while it's being fixed that only has the ability to text and call, but I at least need those capabilities uninterrupted while going through the process of a claim. It is ridiculous that I pay for the service through Verizon, but NEVER go through them, my 'trusted' service provider, to deal with the issue of the protection plan that they advertise and push me to sign up for. That's some serious cognitive dissonance. The rep at Verizon literally have me a post-it note with your website written out in highlighter. Seriously?! You don't even have a printout, pre-formatted email, card, etc. to give customers that need to file a claim? Don't you expect them to go to the Verizon store to get help with their not-iPhone? God help you all, especially your marketing and service departments."

I told the associate that I needed my phone for work and asked for a different model. I was told that I couldn't get a different model phone and that I would have to wait for my phone model to become available or cancel the claim. This experience really had me wondering if insurance is even worth it. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is because they somehow got my phone delivered to me before the initial approximate of 5 business days. Very frustrating experience.

I was told by Assurion they have loaner phones while my phone would be getting fixed. Then I was told, "" because I have an expensive phone, loaners weren't available to me."" If I wanted a replacement phone it would be $275 deductible.  Why am I paying a monthly fee for insurance I can't utilize? Why cant I have a loaner phone while mines being fixed? Why have insurance it they can't solve the problem? It makes no sense. Assurian is a BIG RIP OFF!!!!"

Asurion screen repair went bad in a month & they wouldn't fix it,Jennifer ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,5 reviews,2019-02-02T19:06:29.000Z,,"Asurion replaced my screen for over $100 deductible.  It worked for about 10 days and then the touch started dragging.  Then my touch ID stopped working.  Within the month, the screen started bleeding on the edges.  I contacted them to get it fixed and they told me I had to file a new claim and pay another $100.  When I pressed the issue, they tried to say it was a device failure, not a screen failure.  I pointed out that a faulty screen repair would absolutely cause these problems.. there is evidence of the issue being related all over the place online.  They refused to honor their bad repair.These insurance plans are not worth it.  You can get a screen replacement for less than the deductible they charge.  And they send you bad refurb phones if you lose yours.  You will never win with these insurance plans.. that's why they offer them.Many people don't realize YOUR PHONE IS COVERED FOR LOSS OR THEFT BY YOUR HOMEOWNERS OR RENTERS INSURANCE!  You don't need the fake insurance AT&T sells."

I dropped my phone off on Tuesday with ups. I tracked it and found out they received the package on Thursday. I didn’t get an email until Friday stating they received it after I called and spoke to a rep at Asurion. The rep then told me I should be getting an email soon with tracking information. I called back around 430 bc I still did not receive an email. I get one about 10:30 stating I would receive my phone on Monday. But the email prior stated I would get the phone 1 or 2 days after they get it. Monday would be 6 days without my phone and they originally got it on Thursday. It’s an inconvenience and poor communication. Then you can’t even give a review on the page. But they post all these good reviews and it’s not true.

No Point in Even Having the Insurance,Melissa Sarah,,US,1 review,2019-01-24T17:07:39.000Z,,"What is the purpose of having insurance if it doesn't actually cover anything? I only needed a screen replacement but the service won't let me do so. Instead it wants me to replace the entire phone. Something that would normally cost $30 according to them would instead cost me $200! That is completely ridiculous. Complete waste of my time and money.Edit in response to Asurion: A tactic I've noticed they've used to all the sincere 1 star reviews is offer to talk to someone about their policies. Why should I, or anyone else, speak to yet another representative telling me I need to pay $200 to fix a screen. Nah, Asurion. If you don't want to people to be mad, you should tell people from the very start if a phone will be covered instead of dragging them through the process before springing a multi hundred dollar bill on them."

Absolutely horrible experience with Asurion.,Kate Midgley,,US,1 review,2019-01-23T13:46:56.000Z,,Absolutely horrible experience with Asurion. I cracked my phone screen for the iPhone XS Max and just wanted a screen replacement. They said they didn’t have the supplies for a screen replacement and that I would need to send my phone in for a new one. I sent the phone back with not a scratch or dent on it other than the screen and I get an email and an additional $170 charge on top of the $29 fee for the screen for the “phone frame being dent”. They refused to believe that it could have been damaged in the mail. There was not a single thing wrong with that frame when I sent it in. All I needed was a screen replacement but because the had no supplies to fix it I ended up having the pay for a new phone replacement. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

The customer service was good,SHEILA,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-01-17T02:28:30.000Z,,"The customer service was good. I wish there was some claim options over the weekend. The deductible is high in my opinion. In two years, you’ve paid about $240 for the policy, then you have a $200 deductible. So once you owe $200 or less on your phone, you should probably cancel it. You also have no options through your cell phone provider so you are without a phone for at least two days, more if the damage happens on Friday night. However, if you have a new phone on a payment plan then you can get a refurbished replacement in 48 hours without much hassle, so that is a good security option for those of us who aren’t rich!"

She was told this insurance was very important and would cover all her problems.  She was not told about what wasn’t covered, deductibles or refurbished replacements.  When her phone a a defect they first said it was covered then said it would cost her $89 because there was an unrelated crack in the glass.  They told her to use her old phone until she could come up with the money.  They said she needed to continue the insurance of $13 on the broken phone.  I found out that was wrong.  Our fault was not thoroughly checking this out.  Their fault was taking advantage of a senior who trusted them because she just wanted a phone.  Unbelievable at best."

First of all everything is automated but when you do get a person on the phone they have no idea how to help they just direct you back to the site. I’ve called multiple times and spoke with 4 different people and none of them have been able to help complete my claim. I have to say that out of the 4 people I talked to they were all very nice and apologetic except for one. My claim is still floating in limbo and I’m frustrated that the only answer is to go back to the site. I will attempt for a fifth time tomorrow morning. We’ll see how that goes.

I bought an iPhone XS Max with bell by…,HellCatRedEye,,CA,1 review,2019-01-14T13:56:37.000Z,,I bought an iPhone XS Max with bell by paying $1500 upfront fee and yes with Asurion insurance plan. I got insurance because the phone itself is worth more than $2200. Unfortunately I lost it in a restaurant. Right away I called Asurion about it and they said that they'll send me an affidavit form and a link where I can upload my documents. So I did everything they said and I got an email saying that I'll receive a notification as soon as it's reviewed please give us 24 business hours. I believe that I waited far more than that but didn't got any answer. So I decided to call Asurion about this they said it's being reviewed and all that. so waited more after that nothing happened called Asurion again and they said the id you submitted is not valid which was a passport. So I again wrote the affidavit clearly and gave them my drivers license but this time waited like for a week and after a week of calling again and again they finally gave me an answer saying that you few years ago had a claim with Asurion and our verification team declines your request and you won't be able to get a replacement device because of that. That's it from our side you can contact bell for more we can't do anything more than this. Bell said talk to Asurion because they are the ones who handle replacement devices. In the end I had to pay off my phone because bell said you're under a contract for 2 years. I don't know what to do anymore. I was helpless. I will suggest not to go for Asurion and pay $16 just for getting a hard time later on getting your claim because I am sure you guys can face the same thing as well. I just wasted $2500 dealing with all this and ended up having a box and accessories of the iPhone. I paid it off because I had no choice left. I have a clean record in everything. Because If I didn't pay the left balance they will screw my credit history and it can go to collections. I don't even have time to go to a court my skipping my work as I got family to support and bills to pay I work 7 days a week. I always tried to get a solution from them but never got helped. Because they don't give a single s**t about this. The representative on the phone with bell and Asurion were enjoying my situation. They just didn't laugh. I am so ripped off. I hope I had a lot of money and time so that I could see these guys in court. :(

Which is rediculous because I could’ve paid around $30 for a screen repair even though it was not my fault that they didn’t have in store services in my state or neighboring states.
"Simple process, clear instructions, no hassle replacement.",Austin ,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-01-13T04:59:18.000Z,,"The process is simple, instructions are clear, shipping is quick. It is a bummer that they don’t have a replacement option in the store and that you have to wait for the replacement to be mailed to you but otherwise the process is smooth.  The representative on the phone was helpful for activating my new device. Overall would recommend to a friend."

They said the address on the label was incorrect and UPS is returning the phone to them. They can then correct the label and resend but it would take another week until I receive my phone back. I asked why they put the incorrect address on the label as the package to send the phone back to them came without a problem but the representative told me she couldn't say. In total best case is 2 weeks they've had my phone. Go with a local company for repairs or insurance. Don't waste your time or money on them.

Got hold of Asurion and they said no proble we will send a new phone out right away.Got an email the next day saying out of stock but would send it out in a couple days. Got an email couple days saying phone was being shipped that day. turns out it was but by ground freight so we received it in 10 days. what we got was a phone loose in a much bigger box which allowed the phone to bounce around inside.Turns out it was a refurbished phone at a cost of 300 to replace our brand new one. told them we didn't want it and were going to send back they send that's fine but they are keeping the 300 dollars. after much spending lots of the time on the phone they promised me that this phone had gone through all the inspections and was basically a brand new phone and had 90 days warranty. gave into their lies and finally decided to just bite the bullet and activate it.turns out it doesn't hold a charge and gets quite warm when you plug it in the phone also turns on and off on its own. called to say its not working and need to fix or relace it but they are saying they decline the repair or replace because I cancelled my SPC.Told them it shouldn't matter because I have emails and voive calls telling me my phone has 90 days warranty and its only been 2 weeks. never dealt with such a sleezy company like this before but they will never see a penny of mine and if I'm ever in a store and someone else is asked if they want this insurance I will not hesitate to tell them the storyReason of review: Warranty issue.Monetary Loss: $1000.Preferred solution: Deliver product or service ordered.

So I waited 14 days due to holidays . Phone never came, I call again and they say the phone was never shipped out because it's on back order and that they will have an update on January 2nd so i call then and nothing to they connect me to corporate rep and they offered to issue a check instead and I would get it in 3-5 business days so I waited and gave a call yesterday the 10th of January and I'm told the check was mailed to wrong address like whats wrong with this picture, so I call today  just to confirm that they called bnk of America to put a stop payment on the check which I guess takes 3-5 be business days then another 7-10 business days to receive the check .. so I called where they say the check was mailed in NY mind you I'm in Florida and the check or anything in my name ever came so I called back to asurion and notified them and they said we know they have the check because we have tracking information lol Im like how ironic is that USPS standard mail doesnt have tracking information must be something new .. asurion runs like a car with no wheels going on 40 days with no phone but still a bill to pay .. and if you look at there reviews they have 2500 positive reviews all posted on 01/11/2019 I guess they're not just good a cooking the books but also cooking reviewsI recorded every call I made to them so hopefully I can send them to a higher office to show how they're such liers"

Used the Asurion website to file a claim for a cracked screen,Tim Wood,,US,1 review,2019-01-10T23:36:26.000Z,,"Used the Asurion website to file a claim for a repair of my cracked screen. Thought it was great that the Tech would come to my office to repair it.  The case I use covers the back of the phone except for the camera. When the Tech got here he found that there was damage the back of my Samsung Note 8.  Submitted the additional damage to Asurion and claim was denied.  When I called Asurion to find out what was going on I was told several different things from the folks I talked to. They wanted me to pay a $275 deductable and get a new phone. I don't want and don't need a new phone. When I finally got to Karen in the Customer Satisfaction/Office of the CEO area all she wanted to do was get me to file my claim online or let her do it and collect the $275 fee.  She took took the time to explain to me that screen repair is not a service that they should provide its a bonus to me the customer.  All I know is that I have paid for it. Everytime I asked a question to understand or tried to discuss something she referred me to the website where everything is clearly explained, the policies are clearly laid out and where the decuctables are clearly stated. At one point she accused me of wanting to have the fee waived, I had to remind her that I had never asked for that and did not want that.  I have a phone I like and just needed the screen repaired. Asurions focus on profit over Customer Satisfaction in this day and age is ridiculous.  Karen focus on getting my money and not delivering service that was paid for is disgusting. I can safely say that I won't be buying ""insurance"" from Asurion and will alert everyone that I can to avoid Asurion at all costs.  Because that is all they will do is cost you."

Accidental Backup Deletion due to Flawed Claim Submission Process,JAMES A,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-01-10T17:13:34.000Z,,"During my claim, the process to submit my claim required me to remove my old iPhone from Find My iPhone before the claim could get started.  Apple requires a two-part verification and since my damaged phone was unusable, I had to go through a lengthy process to actually get access to my account.  After a week of waiting, I assumed my claim was submitted, but was stalled at the last phase.  When finally accessing my account through Apple, I accidentally deleted my iPhone backup permanently deleting it.  When this happened, I did not see at the time any other options to clear that from my account and to get my claim actually started.When I received my replacement phone, I found out my fault in deleting my backup.  The Assurion tech offer whatever support he could, but was ultimately fruitless.In past claims, customers had to delete their iPhone from Find My iPhone after receiving the new and before returning their old device.  I understand the Asurion requirements, but had I had this option to submit my claim, I.e. not having to delete my account BEFORE a claim could be started, then I wouldn’t have lost over a years worth of personal and business data from my device.Aside from this, the process was relatively simple and satisfactory."

Today is Thursday and Ivd been told different days for when my warranty expires beenhi g up on and was told that a tech was coming today between 8-4. I too the day off because a supervisor from Asurion confirmed it. I voiced my concern that if it was for sure cause I didn’t want to take day off and it not be correct. They said no sir it is for sure on this day. Well guess what I called company because they didn’t call this Morning to give me exact time. and they said no I was not on schedule today after I took day off. They said they told Asurion to never guarantee a date Until one of their techs contacts customer. After talking with company I contacted Asurion they keep saying no it is today.

I did not.  I had to keep checking the website which is not the most convenient way to get updates.  Then when my new phone arrived, we had a horrible time working with customer service getting the data to transfer.  We are still trying to get it all transferred either to the new phone or to our personal laptop.  However, I love the new phone itself."

VERY DISSAPPOINTED,Stephanie Prothro,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-01-07T15:32:23.000Z,,"Decided to exchange my iPhone XS Max and within 2 weeks of having it dropped it- mistakenly. I had purchased a Zagg screen protector for the front which didn’t cause any damage, but it did crack the back of the phone. When I initially called Asurion a representative told me I would only have to pay $30.00 one time curtosy exchange fee since they don’t repair that in my area. A week later I’m getting a receipt from Asurion saying I owe another 170 because there was more damage to the phone then first told. I call again, and another representative tells me it looks like I’ve only been charged the 30 and they won’t be charging me anymore for this phone. Fast forward to today when my account was charged with the 170 and when I called this time, now it’s they can’t do anything and they don’t repair the back of the phone and whoever told me that was wrong. I also heard I must have been talking to someone from Verizon, as to insinuate, I’m an idot and called Verizon and not them. I literally pulled up the e mail and called the number on the e mail list.  I am upset I heard 3 different things within two weeks and what exactly am I paying insurance for anyways? Also, insulting my intelligence isn’t the way to keep anyone’s business. Just disappointed and wouldn’t recommended them to anyone right now."

Sent us an old refurbished phone,Cynthia Choate,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2019-01-06T21:53:15.000Z,,Sent us an old refurbished phone. Had 2 problems with it right away  When we called them about it they said they could do nothing about it.  Told us it was under warranty with the manufacturer and to call ATT. ATT told us to call them  Got the run around from both sides.  Then the screen got cracked and they sent us a 2015 restored phone and want 225.for it. It's also not under a warranty.  ATT said the serial number was the same as our old phone.  I just spent hours trying to get some info from Apple  They said it's not covered and it would be 170. to get the screen fixed so I don't know what to do but it's been hell.  DON'T insure with Asurion !!! It's a rip  ATT too!

I would give less stars.....,Judy Henderson,,US,1 review,2019-01-04T01:44:45.000Z,,I would give less stars if it was possible. The people working after normal business hours are very rude and will not listen to the customers. They read from the cue cards and have no clue what is actually going on. My initial claim to replace an iwatch was started 10 days ago. They could not do the claim within the computer system so it needed to be entered manually. I still have not recieved my watch so I called today for an update. The first person said the claim was started for an unlocked non ATT device. I requested to speak with someone else. The second person said there was no claim started. I asked to speak with someone else. The third person said I was being rude and he would not help me. He switched me to someone named Erica. I was on hold with her for over 10 minutes. She said she found the initial claim but I needed to verify the information that was submitted 10 days ago. Information given and verified. Again on hold 7 minutes. Erica came back to the line and stated that I needed to send an affidavit and a copy of my drivers license. When I questioned why this was needed after 20 years an ATT customer and using Asurian for 10 of those years she just reread the cue card stating that I needed to submit the documentation. I believe it is time to leave ATT and asurion until they get a customer service department that can do more than read a card and a script!!!

There was a preset date in the field that I could not change so I got a message that said I didn't have insurance at the time of damage and was not covered. Very annoying.

Disappointed in their not doing as they said they would,Charlie Riley,,US,1 review,2018-12-31T23:42:23.000Z,,"Contacted Asurion after having the all our family phones on the Verizon Plan covered for over a year (which means I paid into them $400 to $500 already). On Saturday when my phone screen broke called them. They said they could not get it fixed for more than a week locally so it would be the same to just send the phone in for repair by Fed-X. The call dropped 2-3 times due to the cell service but I stuck with it and called back until the claim was complete and I had double checked the address for the Fed-X mailer etc. They assured me the mailer would arrive on Monday so it would be fixed and returned end of the week give or take a day or two. I find out on Monday afternoon after waiting around for Fed-X and following all the instructions (backing up the phone, turning off find phone features etc.) that they didn't get the order to Fed-X to get me the mailer to return the phone until that morning (Monday) so now the return mailer won't get to me until Wed delaying my repair for another 3-4 days. They should not have had me run the hoops on my end if they were not going to get the pickup packaging to me until Wednesday. They called it a inconvenience when I called them. It is not the end of the world but just would have been better if they had not setup an expectation that they were not going to follow through on. The delay was not with Fed-X but rather their own operation. I now have a lack of confidence in their whole process. Will they take weeks and weeks to get my repaired phone back? Will they lose it? Ship it to the wrong address? etc.In hindsight I probably should have saved the money and self insured. I could have paid someone to fix the screen locally or even purchased a refurbished phone for the money and not have felt jerked around."

My replacement phone came quickly with no hassle until I realized it did not have a sim card.  I was told the sim card would be there the next day by 8pm (Fri). It did not come and I called and was told there was nothing they could do.  I got the sim card Monday eve. Then my phone would not activate. After several calls I finally talked to a tech and got it working.

Received replacement phone December 19.  Setup phone and tried making a call. Stated phone has been blocked from AT&T network.  Call and worked with provider over 45 mins. Was told phone was on the blacklist for stolen phones but though they had it activated. This was at nine pm. Phone returned to blacklist at 10:30 pm.  Went to AT&T store December 20th. They said they had never seen this happen. Spent two hours in store on phone.  Finally got another replacement that works. Terrible experience!!!

If I choose ""great"", then I can leave a review. If I choose ""not great"" I get sent to a screen for customer service. I want to leave a review, either way.The representative I reached to set up my replacement phone didn't listen(would ask me what screen I was on and then repeat that I was on a different screen, repeatedly), she didn't go step by step(I told her I didn't have the sim card in, she proceded anyway and didn't tell me to install it, she was all over the place)and she seemed uninterested. I decided I'd call back later and hopefully the next rep would be better."

iPhone X Repair:  2 WEEKS AND COUNTING,Dave Trichter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-12-19T03:44:40.000Z,,"2 WEEKS AND COUNTING.  8+ HOURS OF PHONE CALLS AND COUNTING.I have an iPhone X on Verizon that has a crack on the screen.   Unfortunately the seamless easy process that is supposed to exist with Asurion's insurance service continues to elude me.Firstly, their ""we'll send someone to you"" policy for iPhone X phone repair apparently does not exist in either New York or Washington DC, so this claim is largely (or fully) fraudulent, as those are pretty major markets.  My local Verizon store had no idea that I would have to mail in my phone.  Next, Asurion repeatedly sent my envelope to the wrong address (St. instead of Pl.), even after the customer service reps say they changed the address in the system on failed delivery.  They claimed that their computer system was automatically changing it back!Once I managed to get my phone in the mail to them, a different customer service rep accidentally cancelled my repair while it was in the warehouse.  I was told to wait until my phone returned home (maybe it would be the correct address?) and start the process over again.  After demanding to speak with a supervisor (who was seemingly very helpful), we agreed to have it shipped to a different location than my home since I will be gone for the Christmas / New Years Holidays.  However, my claim number was changed without my knowledge so I couldn't check on the status.  So...I called again today (for hopefully the last time) to check the status of my claim.  They still haven't started working on it, and I was told that an alternative address from my home address is not a possibility.  So I likely will not have my phone for the holidays.  They could have agreed to expedite the process for me, override the system to send it to an address of my choice, or bite the bullet and send me an immediate replacement phone given all the human and/or systems error on their end, but they had no interest in any of these reasonable solutions.  Only the mechanical ""I'm Sorry for the inconvenience"".  BEWARE."

Asurion would send someone out and replace it for $49. WOW! That's great!Last click to make the appointment and WAIT A SECOND! They wanted me to accept the terms and one of those terms was (paraphrasing here) ""even though we use quality aftermarket parts, we CANNOT guarantee your waterproof phone will be waterproof after the repair. We also can't guarantee everything will function as it did. WHAT? Apparently, Asurion is not very confident in the mobile repair crew and the cheap repair parts.I also could not cancel the repair appointment online. I needed to call. Even though I didn't click ""accept"" for that nonsense, they still had the appointment scheduled. So, since I didn't made a claim in a while, I had them replace the phone with a new one for $112.

So I tried again with the more expensive option of replacement.  The new phone arrived quickly, I called Asurion and spoke with an agent that helped me transfer the contents of the old phone to the new.  I could not find a cable cord to do this directly so the agent helped me do it by wifi. A few apps did not transfer, so I assume it was because of the wifi.  It would be nice if the phone-to-phone cable came with the new phone.  All in all, the agent was excellent and my new phone was up and running within 30 minutes, although it then took a while to download the apps that did not transfer and log into them all again."

My phone fell about 5’, the screen did not shatter, instead the phone landed on the bottom edge.  This caused the charging port to be misaligned, preventing the charging cord from plugging in, not a big issue because this phone has wireless charging.  The real problem was that the impact created a white line, about 3/16” to run vertically the entire length of the phone while held vertically, or horizontal while beiheld horizontally.I brought the phone to my local store, filed a claim, and the next day I had a replacement phone.

I understand that  FEDEX is responsible for the delivery but if the person was not available they should try later or leave a message for pick-up at a FEDEX center."

Asurion are liars!,Raquel Patterson,,US,1 review,2018-12-16T17:28:10.000Z,,"Asurion are liars! They sell false protection agreements and takes advantage of our military personnel and their families. They offer protection plans when it's already covered in the manufacturing company and their extended plan only covers for one year after the manufacturer. A two year plan only covers one year! And when you purchase it for a Christmas gift, the do not accept the date of gift..... So don't buy it on black Friday and expect to get help after that date..... Because it's expired!  The customer service reps are trained to be rude and they  don't appreciate the military protect them in the US.... Cause it's not a US company!!!! Boycot them!!!! Why is our military allowing this to be sold at the exchange? They are setting us up to pay for something they won't fix... Just take our money and nothing when it's needed and paid for.... The exchange and asurion should be sued!"
Worst phone replacement company,MG,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-12-16T17:10:00.000Z,,"The process to get a replacement was unacceptable. More so, this entire phone thing is a financial scam. These phones are not built to last the time contracts hold the consumer responsible. This company charges near $15 a month, PLUS $149.00 replacement. The cost to own a phone for a two year period comes to unacceptable numbers! Apple charges $99 a year plus $99 replacement, as does the Costco company. Saurian delivered a replacement that was dirty, had someones apps on it and the screen protection cover was not on the phone upon arrival. It was poorly packaged . What an unacceptable exchange for my hard earned dollars to this crummy phone that they thought acceptable. This is my last contract with them"

First time great second times the last,Aleah Manoogian,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-12-12T19:59:03.000Z,,"First off I've used this company before to fix my phone and it only took 3 days and it was quick and efficient. This time however the customer service was nice but not helpful. I waited a week without shipping material and when I didn't receive any I got an email saying my package was on its way back to them with my phone. I NEVER EVEN GOT THE PACKAGE. So I then proceeded to online chat with Asurion because I don't have a working phone (reason I am using the insurance I've been paying for for 2 yrs). They told me it was a mistake email and that my shipping material would arrive monday (3 days bc it was friday) Come monday nothing, tuesday nothing. The new tracking number kept saying shipping label created expected delivery that monday. So when I chatted with the company again and they said I had to call because they couldn't help me even when I stated I didn't have a phone to call they proceeded to ask me to borrow someones phone. Even After another conversation they couldn't cancel my claim and they wanted me to call in a couple days. Then when I called again they said That I should call this coming monday to refile my claim and I should receive new shipping material that tuesday. So overall its going to take me about a month to get my phone fixed because they messed up and they didn't even offer me anything. Will not be using this company again its a shame."

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,JP,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,8 reviews,2018-12-10T22:31:38.000Z,,"1) Worst customer service with the worst reception(puts you on hold, hangs up never calls back)2) Was told they ""come to you to fix your screen in minutes"" when I got my iPhone X. That option is not available. If you want your screen fixed you'll most likely pay 199$ because the 29$ option will require you to ship them your phone for days which leaves you with no phone.3) Good luck if you have more than 3 lines.... you will have to call your provider and asurion at least 10 times before you can file claims on your damaged phone.Paid $39.99 for 2 years for nothing."

My daughter dropped her phone and it needed to be replaced. At first I was surprised Asurion didn't have the option to upgrade the phone, they would only send me the same model she damaged. In the end they charged me $185 as a deductible for a replacement, when the replacement arrived it was a refurbished Iphone that I could have bought online for $185. I'm sending the phone back now. I have paid hundreds of dollars for this insurance and all they ended up doing is selling me a used iphone. I will be finding a new company to work with in the new year."

Having “loaner phones” available at the AT&T stores or other phone stores would be a vast improvement over being without a phone while waiting.

"Asurion is a fraud so are the carriers as well ""Verizon""",Jimmy Lakey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-12-08T21:43:20.000Z,,"Asurion is a fraud ! Just  another way to take your money along with cell phone providers, in my case ""Verizon""! They promise alot of thing and you pay for the top insurance but when you need them to help you and uphold there integrity they are just trying to take your money. They lie and say that they have repair techs and locations to fix a cracked screen for $29. When it occurs they just so happen to not have the parts ,facilities, or techs. Let's keep in mind though they expect you to pay the monthly payments along with the carrier or late fees apply.  I had a crack a few months back the lady said I had to pay the full deduction $175-200 dollars for a replacement she said there were no other options. I just cracked my screen  a few months later and a guy from asurion came to my house and took 10 mins and fixed it for $29 next day. They dont hold any honesty they just want their commission and the phone carriers let them get away with it and dont help there customers. Best buy is the place to get insurance ,cheaper cost,honest people and same day service. Dont make the mistake to go with asurion then and the carriers dont care about anything expect more money. They can't even admit the mistake and give you money back or a credit they are full of excuses. Cant believe this company is used by every provider.  Horrible horrible horrible. Horrible  Verizon customer support as well Jimmy Lakey"

They made every excuse and stated I would have to pay and get reimbursed. I left the phone on the car at the car wash. The phone was not submerged in water. The phone is water resistant. The phone is functional - Just no display. Have to pay on my own. $325.00 to have my phone fixed today. Not worth paying a monthly insurance premium. And yes, I called Asurion with my concern.

I don't often have to use insurance (about once every 3rd phone (6 to 8 years). This time mine accidentally fell out of  a pocket without knowing it and got run over. The good thing is, Asurion is quick about replacing. But for the amount the phones and insurance cost they could anti-up a NEW phone at least one time in an insurance period. The replacement phone seems to drop calls FAR more than my original."

Disadvantages of Rural lLving,DANIEL E,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-12-06T04:28:06.000Z,,"Because I live in such a rural community, things aren’t as convenient. I had a choice of replacing the phone for $200 or just replacing the screen for $30. It was not really a choice because I would have had to travel excessive distance for the cheaper option. Unfortunately, there were no technicians close to where I live to work on my phone. I’m used to that. What dismayed me was when I was trying to explain this on the phone, the woman from Asurion said, “That’s your problem.” That’s NOT what I consider to be good customer service!"

TERRIBLE experience with Insurance plan I bought through BJS.  they gave me the runaround for five months making me send my vacuum cleaner in and having me receive it back broken worse than it was when I sent it. Agent asked me to donate the vacuum and get a proof of disposal and they would send me a check for a buyout. I did everything humanly possible to get my vacuum fixed or replaced!! Not worth the money for the insurance.  It was a horrible experience to say the least and I will never buy a Nother insurance plan from them again .  I went to BJ’s to see who I could talk to about recouping my money for the insurance that I paid  and letting them know how they treated me as a customer. No vacuum, no money returned and a $20 insurance policy that was worth nothing !!"

Repair tech experience,Customer,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-12-04T21:24:39.000Z,,"I broke the front glass on my galaxy s8+ at work on Saturday 12/1. Filed a claim online that night and opted to go with the repair rather than a refurbished replacement phone since the damage was so minor. Scheduled an appointment for today 12/4 and the technician arrived right on time, was courteous and professional. To top it all off I received a new battery, frame and rear glass on the repair ($300+ worth of parts) even though it was a simple crack on the front of the phone, the tech literally just transferred the camera and motherboard into a brand new phone.Overall, well worth the $8 a month I pay through AT&T. Top notch company, excellent customer service, would highly recommend to anyone."

Where to begin,Melissa Mimi Thomas,,US,1 review,2018-12-04T17:47:34.000Z,,"Where to begin, for starters I have a galaxy s8+ with Verizon. I've had this phone for about 2 years, my screen finally cracked in the corner and I resourced to my insurance I pay 13 a month for to get the screen fixed. So, online I was able to schedule and pay the deducable of $29 and a technician will come to my home and repair my phone. I scheduled a day in October 2018 and took a day off of work to be there at the time 11-1. Well the day came and I waited till 3pm for the tech, he never showed. I thought okay things happen, so I contacted asurion and they couldnt contact the tech. They advised me to reschedule my repair so I did. The next appointment available was in November at the end of the month for the same time 11-1. Within the next month my phones screen was getting much worse glass was falling out of the screen with new cracks was sprouting from the corner. The day came for my phone to be repaired I waited again and no one showed another day off work to do this. I can say at this point I'm furious. So I contact asurion they again cannot explain why this tech didnt show, they wanted me to reschedule again. I told them no way something else needs to be done. I can take my phone somewhere to be repaired or something other than having someone not show again. Asurion got in touch with their service department, they told me there wasn't a tech in my area or even close to come to my home and make the repair and they didnt know why multiple Customer service agents was scheduling the repair multiple times. So their next solution was to send me out another phone. With the deductable I had already paid and they said they would wave the extra fee for the new phone they would send me which was $170. The $170+$29 is $199. Over the phone the customer service agent couldnt give me a confirmation or a tracking number for the new phone but advised me it would be here Tuesday, it was Thursday. I figured that's pretty quick considering the weekend. Tuesday came around no phone, I waited till Wednesday to call them back to find out the order wasnt completed because they didnt have a card on file, for just incase didnt return my old phone within 15 days. I gave them my card to put on file, I was reassured multiple times my card wouldnt be charged unless I didnt return the old phone. I asked this countless times. In my gut I knew it was going to be charged, but it was a chance I had to take i needed a new phone. So few days later I get the phone on a Saturday and I set it up. Checked my bank account they charged me $170 for this phone when I was assured the fee was waved. I called them back they told me we see the fee is waved and we dont know why the charge was taken out of your account. We dont see it was charged on our end. Well i had a reference number from my bank and she told me to give it a few days it may disappear but if it doesn't to call them back. Low and behold it didnt disappear. So, I called them back told them the issue everytime I call its added more to the problem for them if the could get it correct the first time. Now they tell me they will refund the money and it will take 3-5 business days to process and be refunded depending on my bank. It took 4 business days, but the refunded amount was only $29 not $170 like promised... it's a constant issue with this company... I'll be making another call to the company for the original $170 to be refunded. This is ridiculous the cant get anything right.After having this ""NEW"" phone for a week its referbrished so it's not brand new like the lady had told me. It's also not the original screen on the phone these phone are to come with a anti scratch screen and this one is very easy to scratch."

At first I was very disappointed…,Candida,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-12-04T01:53:19.000Z,,At first I was very disappointed because when I called initially my first service rep ( a young man) simply told me I was outside of my 30days where I could get a replacement device because my first one was malfunctioning a week after getting it. This was all within 30 seconds of being on the phone with me & as I hung up confused because I knew that information  couldn’t be right. I checked through my emails and realized he had made a mistake with the information he had on hand. I called back and a kind young lady (the second service rep) listened to my concern and confirmed my dates of when my claim initially started and when I actually receive my first device. She understood and was empathetic to my concern and problem and took ownership of the first person mistake & helped me and that’s in my opinion is what customer service is about. She checked the data base thoroughly and was confused herself as to why the first customer service rep said what he said to me but she did her due diligence and started my new claim and was able to order my device. Although my claim wasn’t done correctly the first time my second rep swooped in and saved the day my doing her job correctly incomparison to the first rep who I believe just wanted to get off the phone with me. I would rate her 5 stars any day.

I called 1-866-853-2601 (connect with a device expert) to set it up my new phone but was transferred to Verizon…I could have just called Verizon, first.

I am not rich, and it is a lot of money to have on hold, oh, and the best part is, they took the money out of my account like the next day! So, they are quick to take it, but very slow to give it back. Lesson is, make sure your phone really is lost before you file, because there is a ton of red tape involved if you need a refund."

Your company is dragging it's feet in doing their job yet, I pay you monthly without pause. How is it that I pay for insurance and are told one thing yet, Asurion does what they want, when they want? Why is it my responsibility to continue inconveniently keep calling YOUR COMPANY back to make sure that someone is doing their job when it is apparent that they're not??? I'm SICK OF IT!!!!! I'm sure that when it is time for me to make payment for my deductible that you will not be as understanding if I take my time to make said paymoent.

Could not get phone replaced,Candace,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-11-27T15:09:06.000Z,,"My phone completely died on me. I tried to file a claim on Asurion's website and was given a message to call customer service. After speaking to them and verifying all my info I was told that I would get an email within 24 hours to complete the claim. I never received an email but went back to the website and the option to complete the claim was there so I completed it. It said my replacement device would be shipped within 1-2 business days. After waiting 2 days I checked back on the website and it said my replacement device was shipped but there was no tracking information available. I was trying to be patient so I waited another day, still no phone (now 4 days since I began the claim). I initiated an online chat with customer service and was told that the delay was due to a ""heavy demand for that device."" I was told to continue checking the website for tracking and if it didn't arrive the next business day to call customer service. Of course it did not arrive so I called. I was told by this representative that the replacement device was on backorder!! She said it was showing her that it was ready to ship so I should keep checking the website for tracking throughout the day and should receive my phone the next day. After checking the website most of the day, by evening there was still no tracking. I called customer service again and was told that it has still not been shipped. She said it might ship the next day and just to wait for an email with tracking info.No one seems to want or be able to help me any more than to tell me it MAY ship and to wait for tracking information. After waiting 8 days, I then received an email saying my shipment would be delayed 7-10 business days! I could not wait another 1-2 weeks for a replacement phone and I could get no one to help me so I canceled the claim and the protection plan with AT&T (which was the easiest part of this whole thing) and went out and bought a new phone. I opted for the protection from the store I purchased it at.  I think making someone who has been paying premiums and a deductible for a replacement phone for years with very few claims go through this is completely unacceptable. I know I will never get anything back from Asurion but hope that this review will help to warn others of this bad rip off service."

Now I’m kicking myself for living with a shattered screen for so long because they made it SO EASY. I completed my claim at 1130 on a Friday night, assuming that my new phone wouldn’t arrive until the following week. I was shocked when it had arrived by 1100 on Saturday morning. The instructions it came with were very simple and easy to follow. The included prepaid envelope to send my old phone back to them was the icing on the cake. Great experience. 5 stars."

I had provided my work address, so I sat in the office all day waiting on the new phone even after my boss told me to close up shop and go enjoy the unseasonably nice afternoon.  It never came.  Today when I called, the new representative I spoke to told me it STILL HASN’T EVEN SHIPPED.  I have now been a week with no phone, and they haven’t even shipped it!!  They are pure scam artists!!

I appreciate the incentive to reduce the amount of you haven’t had a claim in a certain amount of time, but it’s still a really steep price. I only had $153 left to pay on my phone, so the $112 deductible was pretty much like paying my phone off. The only thing that kept me from upgrading was that I would have to pay the $153 plus taxes, plus upgrade fee. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have used your service. Will discontinue insurance service."

"I used to love them, now I am a lost customer",FarFromTheMall,,US,4 reviews,2018-11-11T02:09:14.000Z,,"For the high aggregated cost of thier service, Asurion really should give the customer better options.I will have my screen replaced at my own cost, and will NOT be continuing with Asurion's service. I regret recommending them to my family and friends and will be sure to rescind the recommendations.Overall, the technicians and agents working at Asurion were great. I never had a problem and in the past they have been competent and helpful. However, my last interaction with Assurion was very disappointing. A few months ago they replaced my phone screen, and over the next few months the replacement screen progressively went bad (according to online tech sources this is a known issue with the screens). Asurion refuses to replace the screen they installed, did not offer to follow up with a technician on my claim, and instead was only willing to send me a replacement phone. My current phone is old enough that I am certain to get a refurbished phone. Why would I want a refurbished phone when my current phone is perfectly fine except for the screen issue on the screen provided by Asurion? I asked to speak to a manager. He gave no help, no technical or cost justification, and stubbornly kept referring back to their process. Even though they provided the screen, AND my solution of screen replacement, still paying the deductible, was theoretically the cheaper of the two options for Assurion, no help! The manager was completely inflexible, unhelpful, and ambivalent.I gave Asurion two stars, instead of one, since they did offer a replacement phone. If I was completely desperate I could have gone that route.A screen replacement from the manufacturer or box store would have cost about the same as my Asurion payments. I should have simply saved the money and gone to a store for same day replacement. The manufacturer or store would have been more likely to stand by the replacement screen."

Super easy to work with,Emma,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-11-03T17:51:53.000Z,,"Super easy to work with. Though I requested the signature be waived because I could not be home during the time of delivery. I was assured that it would be waived and not be a problem. But, the signature was required, I was not home and ended up having to drive 30min to and from the UPS shipping center to retrieve my phone. I was also frustrated because I called, and the voice prompt said to place a claim online - online it said that they were out of my phone and it was backordered. I waited a day and heard nothing and decided to call someone to ask when I could expect the phone to not be backordered. The person on the phone then informed me my phone was not backordered and they could next day it. I was of course not going to be home, but had someone/online had the phone the day before I could've been home to sign for the package. Overall, they got me the replacement phone and walked me through turning off ""find my iPhone"" just the lapse of ""backordered"" phone and the waiving of the signature was frustrating and added more stress to trying to figure out how to get my phone back."
Shipping was fast but customer service…,Sal Kay,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-11-03T17:27:08.000Z,,Shipping was fast but customer service needs to understand that we need a phone and stop asking about troubleshooting steps.

They give you the run around on the phone and do not try to fix your problem. Have ordered a replacement phone twice just to receive the wrong phone and the ignorant lady on the phone deliberately sent the wrong phone. This is by far the worse company for customer service.

"Very unhappy, dissatisfied,and angry customer!",Dezmond Sutton,,US,1 review,2018-10-29T21:51:24.000Z,,"I am writing because I'm very unhappy and dissatisfied with the service provided by Asurion. I've had issues in the past with Asurion and receiving defected replacement phones. It took four replacement phones and then my suggestion of upgrading my phone to the next generation before my issue was resolved. I now have another issue with Asurion that I truly don't think is fair to your customers.  I purchased the Note 8 when it first came out because of its multitasking capabilities and that it was rated IP68. My original phone I received when I first bought the Note 8 worked wonderfully. I was able to use my phone in and/or near my pool. Unfortunately, I cracked the screen and had to pay 199 for a replacement; however, the Note 8 replacement device I received is not water resisted at all. The other day while using the phone in less than 3 feet of water, the phone got wet and powered off. It now won’t power up or charge. Even though there is no other physical damage and is still under their one year warranty, Asurion assists that I pay another 199 to replace a phone that is touted as water resistance up to submersion of 1.5 meters of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. It seems the replacement device was opened and repaired by Asurion and wasn't properly sealed. My Note 8 device now has no IP rating at all! Not sure how that is fair to the consumer who purchases this device because of the IP rating and capabilities. Asurion has no integrity, no ethical boundaries, and downright appalling. Asurion has to be the worse phone insurance company on the planet to think that the consumer should have to pay for another replacement for a device that wasn't sealed properly by them in the first place! I am a very unhappy, dissatisfied, and angry customer!"

No compassion,Jennifer Sullivan,,US,1 review,2018-10-29T17:28:44.000Z,,"My phone broke on a Friday afternoon, was told by att that if I  placed my claim before 5:30pm I’ll have the exact same phone delivered to me on Saturday. So that’s what I did. So I  went online and filed a claimed, I needed to sign an affidavit and send it over with the claim.  They said they received my documents and I will not be getting my rose gold phone but a black one instead. I received an email after I filed the claim and said i would hear back within 24 hours. The weekend came and went and never heard anything from asurion, until today Monday. They needed more information from me. So I called them and they told me the affidavit needed to be signed by the primary phone holder who is my mother. My mother had major operation on legs 9/25 and has been in and out of the hospital since. She’s been currently in th hospital since October 10th due to many complications after her surgery. She’s in the ICU where no children are allowed and being a single mother myself it hasn’t been easy going to visit her. But asurion has no compassion and wasn’t willing to work with me even though my mother has me on the account to makes changes they still wouldn’t accept my signature. So I’m left now without a phone for probably another few days while I have 2 young children at home and a sick mother in the hospital. If and when my mother gets out of the hospital I’ll make sure she switches."

Once I called they said it couldn’t be repaired so need to send a replacement. They didn’t have the same color iPhone. I requested a brand new one as her phone was only 3 months old. They claim it was new but it didn’t come in an iPhone box and the accessories supplied were not genuine Apple chargers. They did overnight it.

They sent a technician to my home to repair it. In the process he broke the home button and apologized profusely stating this was the first time he had worked in an Iphone. Asurion sent me a phone which was obviously used and the battery lasted about 24 hours. I sent it back. They sent another phone and the battery died after 2 weeks. I sent it back. I have asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that it is not their policy to replace any phones with new phones and I could not speak with a supervisor. They assured me when they sent the second one that it would be a ""good"" one.I spoke with Asurion today was told they would ""save me a new red phone"" but I needed to call back when I had access to my ICloud account. When I called them back I was told by another person that they no longer make red phones. She said all phones were on back order and it would 3-7 days before I would get another phone.My original almost new phone was in perfect working condition and now I am receiving repeated defective phones because of an error by their technician.What a rip off!!!"

Heavy accent) of Asurion... After numerous transfers and calls between Asurion and Sprint, I also spoke with a Hannah of Asurion in which i requested a supervisor. I had a rather testy conversation with an Irene,  who was alleged to be a supervisor for Asurion. Irene angrily stated that Asurion had NOTHING to do with the process of cancelling any insurances. I calmly asked, why would the Sprint representative tell me that, and then give me the name and contact number of Asurion?  After a couple more TRANSFERS, Donna,(Sprint) Amanda(Asurion??), Amanda assured me that my insurance WILL be cancelled within 2 business days.  But I was appalled to learn that Amanda confirmed that she actually works for Asurion... And that THEY ARE THE ENTITY that's charged with the responsibility of cancelling insurances...WOW REALLY?!!   What???... Did someone just NOT want me to cancel my insurance or just subject me to a bunch of wasted time and energy?!  I asked for a reference number, Amanad told me, I would receive an email confirming our conversation and the cancelling of the insurance.  An hour later i still have not received that email... Will be interesting to see how my 2 year old phone behaves after this review. This was a very rotten experience to say the least!!  Be forewarned... I will update this thread going forward.Not a happy camper"

1st time using my insurance (Asurion),MIGUEL M,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-10-20T15:12:42.000Z,,1st time using my insurance (Asurion). I was dreading it at 1st but once I got on it was very quick and easy. Probably took 5 mins. Got my replacement phone the very next day since I ordered it earlier enough in the previous day. They give you easy instructions on how to send damaged phone back. A++ I give them.

Online help was useless to us and the personnel at South Hill, VA just referred us to online or a phone number to use.  Both of these were totally useless to us but finally found help at your kiosk at COSTCO in Richmond, VA who referred us to your store on Midlothian Turnpike where the assistant manager was immediately helpful and had it all settled in fewer than ten minutes."

As promised,STACY F,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-10-20T12:21:17.000Z,,"My screen was badly damaged.  When I turned it in to be repaired, it was beyond repair, so Asurion sent me a new phone right away. All total, I was without a phone for 4 days.  Even though my phone was beyond repair and I received a new phone, they still sent my old phone back to me with a return envelope. So my old phone made a second trip back to them.  I understand that it may be two separate transactions (repair or replace), but it seemed like a waste of time and expense to ship it twice.The customer service over the phone was top of the line.  Every rep I spoke to was knowledgeable and patient.  Everything was exactly as promised , as well."

My screen got cracked on my phone when…,EDWARD K,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-10-20T02:23:46.000Z,,"My screen got cracked on my phone when it accidentally slipped off the windshield mount as I was driving using the GPS and Google Maps. My phone was only about 6 months old, darn it! But a phone call to Verizon and they pointed me to Asurion for the replacement. With a single phone call to Asurion they approved my claim and sent out a phone immediately. I had my replacement phone the very next day! That was awesome service. But I had problems with the replacement phone, which was not my original phone, but supposedly an upgrade from it. Ok. I went through the permissions and saw that Google wanted to be able to activate my microphone at it's discretion...(What?!) No, denied. That is a ridiculous intrusion into my privacy. But then the next day I began using my phone while driving with the GPS and Google Maps App...and the phone would make pop ups come onto the screen and make a annoying notification noise which told me that Google Maps was having problems and would not work right unless I corrected the permissions. I would not. And it would do pop ups and the noise literally every 60 seconds while I was trying to use the Google Maps GPS. I am new to this area and must use GPS for my work or else I can not get around. I have to use it. My old phone would not do this and this was totally unacceptable to me as a replacement phone. I called Asurion back and explained the problem and they tried to help me to turn those notifications off, but continued use did confirm that the notifications were still happening, Totally unacceptable as a replacement phone! I asked for my original model phone back, I did not want a so called upgrade which was no upgrade to me! It was potentially dangerous for me and could have caused me to get into an auto accident by blocking my Google Maps screen with the popups and me trying to drive and see the screen. Asurion told me that they did not have any phones of the same model that I had before...OkI called Verizon and explained the problem with the replacement phone. They too, also tried to help me shut off the pop ups and notifications, again unsuccessfully. So I told Verizon that this was an unacceptable replacement phone for me and that they were going to have to provide another replacement phone which would not do these things. The said it is not possible. I asked for a phone of my original model and they told me that that model phone could not evn wotk on their system anymore. I did not believe that. That phone was only 6 months old. They essentially said ""tough"". Repeated calls to verizon were met with disdain and no customer service whatsoever. In frustration, I again called Asurion, and they tried again to help me turn off the pop ups, etc., to no avail. I said why couldn't I just get my old phone back again and only that. It worked good and did not have annoyances built in. The nice lady from Asurion said, oh we can do that. I said, huh? they said no before. Oh we were just out of stock, we have them now...So I got my original model phone back the next day again.I called verizon to activate it without saying anything, to see if they could or could not activate it, and they could and they did...Problem solved. Thank You Asurion. This is proof that Verizon lied to me. It has been working fine, the GPS and Maps is good. No problems. I was about to leave Verizon as a customer because they lied...But the way that Asurion treated me, has made me decide to stay. Not because of Verizon...because of Asurion and their professionalism and level of customer service. Verizon bad LIARS.Asurion GOOD..."

My Iphone 8 plus has a shattered…,Alyssa Clark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-10-18T16:11:54.000Z,,"My Iphone 8 plus has a shattered screen. 7 days ago I filed a claim with the company Asurion. I paid $29 to have the phone fixed. The website stated on the claim file page that if they cannot fix the phone they will send out a replacement phone. Now, 7 days later, the website is completely different from when I filed the claim. When you have a shattered screen, an Iphone screen at that, obviously its going to come with touch screen issues. Fast forward to today. They are sending the shattered phone back. And asking me to pay $170 extra dollars to send out a replacement phone. I called and spoke with 4 people the first person I did not get a name. The second person was Cheryl, the third person was Jennifer with care solutions, and the fourth person was apparently from their ""CEO OFFICE"" Melissa with the ID number IDT162655. She did not deny the fact that the website stated this, and kept saying that there was a malfunction with the screen which is why they could not replace the phone/fix the phone. My issue with this, is that the website didn't say if anything was wrong with the LCD screen they would not be able to fix the phone and you would be required to buy a replacement. It asked if the screen was shattered, obviously I said yes. They said great, send it in and we'll fix it or replace it within 3 business days. I was told the same thing over and over again. I was not offered any sympathy for their misrepresentation and false advertising. I was ""apologized"" to but that apology was always followed by a ""but"". I have paid for insurance with this company for 7 years. I have filed 2 claims now. One a few  years ago, they sent me a refurbished phone (which okay, i get that) but the first one was so crappy that it would not work. They sent out a new one, but it was like pulling teeth to get them to replace the one they just sent. They sent the second one and it was almost as crappy but at least this one worked. I only had to have it for 3 months so I left it alone. I'm extremely upset with the lack of assistance that I received. I am extremely upset with the false advertising and misrepresentation, that they clearly knew was happening since they removed it from their site within 5 days. If you can help it, dont use this company. Just don't."

Not happy with my experience at all,Anna Mack,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-10-17T17:26:40.000Z,,"I got the run-around for days. Their website didn’t work properly and because of that we were continually penalized with delays for issues that were out of our control. After 5 days we finally got our replacement phone. It would have been delayed another day or two if I didn’t ask to speak to a supervisor and insist that our claim review be expedited. Customer service reps were very nice and understanding of my frustration. It’s just unfortunate that their reimbursement process has become so disjointed and slow from when I used this company 5+ years ago. At that time, I received a new phone just 24 hours after my claim was filed. This time around I got a new phone only after days and days of headaches. I’m seriously considering using a new insurance company - Best Buy is more expensive but at this point I’d rather pay more money than deal with this fiasco again."

You pay for insurance for your phones and when you file a claim, they up the price of the deductible from what was quoted to replace the phone with a refurbished phone that probably already had issues. Why even pay for insurance if they try to get the most they can get to replace your phone with a second or third hand phone that won't last more than a couple of months which is what happened and the deductible keeps going up each time."

HORRIBLE!!,Susan Fodor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-10-03T23:57:46.000Z,,"This has been the worst experience with customer service ever. Just lies and more lies every day when I call just to get me off the phone. I pay alot of money for insurance on my sons phone and then pay a very high deductible when it gets damaged. But I cant get anyone to actually SEND me the replacement phone. I am on hold with them now for the 7th time in the last 7 days. On Sept 26 I filed my claim online and received an email that it had shipped and I would have it the next day. But the email did not include a tracking number of course and neither did their website status tracking. Every time I talk to them to say I still dont have the phone they lie and tell me that it is shipping that day and I will have it the next day. Well here it is the 3rd of October and I was told on Monday that it would be here today. No phone still! In the beginning I was told that my online claim was ""cancelled by our system"". So then she refiled my claim over the phone and then I had to have another claim filed over the phone the day after that because they couldnt find it. Then I called on Monday and was told that the phone has been ready to ship for a week but they were waiting on my payment to clear!! Really? I paid for the claim ONLINE with my debit card and the money was deducted immediately. So again, lies about why they are not shipping it. Now I cant get through to a CSR if I type in my phone number at the beginning. I am just immediately disconnected. I did this 4 times and was disconnected every time. So this time I called back and typed in a different number and was put right through to the call queue. What a bunch of crap!"

The 1st time I paid a $99 deductible and received an iPhone 5s in place of my iPhone 5, which I had dropped in water. The 2nd time, almost 3 years later, I paid a $75 deductible and received an iPhone 6 in place of my iPhone 5s, which had a cracked screen. The monthly insurance price of $8.99 is definitely worth it for the cost of an iPhone. I am very pleased with Asurion!"

After the fact I have taken off work for this. I called the company to explain and the first person hung up on me after she put me on hold for 20min. So I called back and asked to speak with a manager. She was no better! I hope and pray this is the last time I have to deal with this company! Now if my phone gets any worse I will have to come out of pocket $199.00 because they cant keep their word. This is not right what so ever! When i broke my phone the first time they was quick to send me another one, but this time with a cracked screen (at any second it can completely break) which only cost me $40 I cant seem to get someone out here! I hope you all have better luck! I will NEVER use this company again!"

But again, when my phone finally arrived and after I had to take it into the office, because I could not perform the activation,  at&t , had to physically do it. However, I am privileged and very proud to say  "" this phone"" thus far works superbly,  and I do believe it will continue to do so. So, thank you, Asurion!"

When Asurion re-sent the phone when I thought the first replacement wasn't charging, they said they would overnight it to me at the out-of-town location I was going to be.

According to the “customer service” rep, there is not a person or place within 50 miles of NYC, Philadelphia or Central NJ who can help with a cracked screen.  Option was to either have my phone mailed in to be repaired (4 days total) or full replacement for $199.  Who can be without their phones for that long and who would want to pay an additional $199 when you already pay for insurance monthly?  Kim, the customer service rep, repeated her company line and refused to think differently about how to solve my issue.  She coudnt even tell me where the nearest location was for me to drive my own phone to get replaced.  And when she said no one above her was at work right now, i asked her to have one of them call me back...her reply “the system wont allow me to do it.”  How about a pen and a piece of paper, Kim?

Unacceptable Customer Service,Sylton Hurdle,,US,2 reviews,2018-09-28T17:15:43.000Z,,"In regards to my claim number 441564028, the way in which this claim has been handled is an embarrassment to your organization. No way should I have had to take this to the level of the Office of the CEO. It should also be noted at the end of my conversation with the representative in the Office of the CEO I was asked if I wanted to participate in a survey to which I answered yes and when transferred the line disconnected.  An accident; I don't think so!  This is another example of how the little guy consumer is taken advantage of and inconvenienced. Most would take it and not make any noise but I refuse to allow you to receive a pass for the shameful treatment that I received as a consumer and senior citizen.My original claim number was 441553991. I followed the procedure as advised on the Asurion website in conjunction with a technical support assistant on 9/27/2018 and waited for the 3 hour time period to pay the $199.00 deductable associated with the insurance policy. The email never came but instead received one that stated the claim was under review and someone would get back to me within 24 hours. This morning I check the claim online to find out the claim was denied because there was no insurance policy in force. The insurance coverage was verified yesterday by both a Verizon representative and an Asurion representative. This morning I learned the policy on my device has been in place since 2016 so I would like to know who made the error. What representative reviewed my case and made the decision to void my claim? I have have been a Verizon customer for many years and always insured my devices with Asurion. Apparently there is no other company that Verizon uses so if I want to continue with Verizon and have insured devices I have to use Asurion. Sounds like a monopoly to me and it would not surprise me to find out the largest shareholder in Asurion is Verizon. If enough consumers understood situations like this we could bring companies like this to their knees and this may result in my time with Verizon as a faithful customer coming to an end."

I cannot remember the last time I posted something like this - I am beyond frustrated. I purchased a Daniel Wellington watch in Dec. 2016, and bought the 2 year service plan warranty. The watch broke, and I have filed a claim, then was told I would be emailed a shipping label (confirmed email address numerous times).I have been in contact with different customer service representatives via email AND phone EIGHT TIMES in the past 2 weeks in regards to the label to be sent to my email, all of whom stated the label was/will be sent to my email. I checked all folders, including junk/spam, found no label, and emailed them each time, to which they promised it would be sent. NOTHING has come yet. I called to complain about this issue 2 days ago, on Monday Sept. 24th, and the rep PROMISED me I would receive a call from them in 1-2 business days to ensure I received label. I have yet to receive any label to my email, and did not receive a call (lied to, once again).I have never had to deal with customer service representatives over one issue EVER, and not to mention, be told false statements regarding my label.I expect Asurion/Walmart to remedy this situation, and then some.

For the last 6 months, or so, the battery has been dying quicker and quicker...and finally gave up the ghost one weekend.  I placed a claim Sunday evening online...and by Wednesday had a replacement phone that was the same as, thought two versions newer, my prior phone...even to the point of being an Active.  There was no ""proof"" needed, though I did have 10 days to return my erased S6.  They provided information on how to activate the new phone, though there were a couple of different ways of doing so and I ended up on the phone with them that evening, but Asurion was professional and quick.

Anyways after I ate a piece of humble pie I called Customer service at Asurian.  Well, to make a long story short  the Asurian Team didn't make me sit in the corner with a dunce cap or put me in a quiet zone for 30 minutes.  In fact, they were very understanding and only giggled a couple time( Thank You Asurian).  It ended up being a very positive experience.

However, the frustration I have experienced with Asurion has caused me to break my online silence.  The screen on my phone cracked. No problem, I thought, I have insurance. I made an appointment for a technician to come the next morning between 9-11. Between 9-11 I wait in my living room for the tech to show up. Nothing. No phone call, text, or email. At 1045 I contact the online live chat to make sure they were still coming or if I should reschedule. They assure me there is still an appointment and I should just give them a few minutes. So again I sit in my living room and wait. At 1130 I contact them again and they say oh sorry our technician said they tried to call me and drove to my house. IMPOSSIBLE! I had no calls or missed calls, no text or email. No one knocked on my door or rang my doorbell. Around 11 I did see a white unlabeled service looking truck pull in front of my neighbors house. I wondered if that was them and even stood out on my porch with my phone. No one got out and it just drove off after a few minutes so I assumed it was unrelated. I contact customer support to try and remedy this situation, even maybe compensate for the inconvenience this has caused me all day and all I get is a whoops sorry I’ll have to reschedule you later this afternoon there’s nothing I can do. What???? I have never been so dissatisfied or disappointed in a company in my life!"

I had to speak with 3 techs to get the job done, so the rating doesn't tell the whole story.1st tech made me take a device that had no cellular ability and hook it up to do a factory reset, which means a re-download of the OS.  As I work in an office, and not at home, gaining access to wifi meant I had to go home...So I went home, factory reset the phone, re-installed the OS, and tried to set the phone up.  It still wouldn't.2nd tech helped me try to trouble shoot the phone, but didn't understand that I couldn't get the iPhone past the Hello, Hola, etc screen.  She then  passed the buck when it became clear to her that she wasn't able to help me.  The problem there was, she just put me on hold, and didn't pass any of my info on to the next tech about my situation.3rd tech did a great job, worked to understand then summarily fix the problem.  She was the real star of the show and I wish I could remember her name so she could be recognized.  If I had gotten her instead of the 2nd tech, this would be a 4 or even 5 star review, that is how far the 1st and 2nd tech drug this experience down...Let me reiterate, the 1st and 2nd tech were awful...THE 3RD TECH WAS AWESOME, AMAZING, AND SOLVED THE PROBLEM!!!Thank you"

Is insurance really worth it?,Don,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-09-16T15:31:46.000Z,,"Here is why the low score.   First,  you replaced my phone.  That was great.   Now,  it cost ME $225 to do that.    I only had the new phone for 11 months.   I owed $377 when I lost it.    For 5 Stars,  I wished you had paid off the phone, the contract, so I could have moved on.   In short, is the current insurance really worth it?   I might have been just as well off paying the phone off, and getting another plan, for just $125 more."

excellent service but copay for replacement is high,Anne Marie,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-09-13T15:19:54.000Z,,The service person I called after my phone was stolen was very helpful and kind. The replacement phone was delivered within less than 24 hours. The only letdown was having to pay $149 for a reconditioned iPhone 6s which is not even a newer model iPhone. I don’t think the co pay should have been so high when I already pay monthly for the insurance. Otherwise good service though.

Worst customer experience ever,Tracy ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-09-13T14:43:41.000Z,,"Worst customer experience ever. Filed a claim, tech called wrong phone number for 30 minute grace period and appointment was rescheduled following day. Left work early for rescheduled appointment and tech was a no call, no show. Called asurion, was on phone 30 minutes with rep who was trying to figure out what happened. Rep disconnected after 30!minutes and did not call me back... and cancelled the claim without anyone’s consent. Called asurion back and was told I had to pay an additional fee for a new claim!! Spoke to a manager who was most unhelpful and decided the phone could now not be fixed. Confused?!! We were. The phone worked fine and could text, call, take pictures. So, now it would cost 150 instead of 29 to replace the entire phone and not just the screen.  Between talking to Verizon and Assurion , this nonsense took HOURS on the phone. Asurion is a total nightmare. Their reps are terrible"

Can't complain about getting a new…,MICHAEL S,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-09-12T01:01:01.000Z,,Can't complain about getting a new phone after only 2 days just didn't know it would be possible without being passed from one person to the next before someone actually helps but When I was told I'll have it in 2 days I didn't believe it and by noon the second day there it was. I went to a Verizon store for them to help me with my claim and it took around 15 min to submit and get a confirmation my phone is on the way

When buying a phone people always think why buy insurance for a phone I'll just buy one when and if the phone breaks.

I'm glad I did me and my husband have insurance on both phones."

Worst Insurance Company!!!!,Obeth Davila,,US,1 review,2018-09-11T17:14:51.000Z,,"This is the worst customer service I have experienced in a while. This company falsely advertises what services they provide, and make you jump through hoops to get anything done. We have two new iPhones under their policy and one of them was dropped and the screen broke. They offer same day repair, but this only applies to certain areas of the country. Of course our area is not listed, so they wanted us to send the phone in and wait 3 to 7 business days to get the screen fixed. We run a business out of that phone, and cannot be without it for more than a couple of hours. They offered to replace the phone, but then we would have to pay $200 for the replacement, when the deductible to fix the phone is only $29. We asked if we could get it fixed locally, and have them reimburse us for the cost of the repair and they declined that request. Very misleading, they don't keep their promises, and they are flat out dishonest and in my book that makes them liars and thieves."

I received the replacement phone quickly and also received my broken phone back the same day.  Upon opening my original phone I noticed there was a lot more damage than the cracked screen and it must have happened during the shipment to fix the screen.  I called to report all this to Asurion and the first manager I spoke with was very rude and refused to refund me any money and told me I had to take it up with FedEx.  I immediately called FedEx and they told me that I couldn't file a claim because I was neither the sender or the receiver on the shipment (both were Asurion), and that they would have to file a claim on my behalf.  I called back again and this time I got an agent by the name of Stephanie.  She was amazing!! I told her the situation and she called FedEx to see what they could do.  Unfortunately what they needed wasnt something Asurion usually did but Stephanie was able to talk to someone and get me the additional money I had been charged for the refurbished phone refunded.  I was so furious with Asurion to start with and offended by the lack of customer service the first lady I spoke with gave me but Stephanie was a complete professional and so nice, and because of her and her customer service I once again have faith in Asurion, so thank you to everyone who helped me with a situation that was not my fault and making me a satisfied customer."

The website would not let me go past the disabling find my iPhone check and I wasn’t ready to do that until the new device came.  I  had to call to have someone reset it (my claim) so I could continue online. 2.  The website would not allow me to continue without putting my credit card in to pay a deductible that I did owe as I was submitting a 2nd claim for a device that arrived damaged from Assurion.  Once I called it was very easy to sort out but I did have to make that second call

I lost my phone to a big boom wave in…,KIM S,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-09-07T04:49:26.000Z,,"I lost my phone to a big boom wave in Mexico..plunk, to the depths of the wild ocean. Alas, I had never used my Asurion insurance for 14 years ( a load of new phones worth!) but when I called from out of the country, they explained and took care of everything. I was lucky I had a friend's phone to call Asurion and Verizon from Mexico, and he had a plan to the US also. I asked many questions, such as: why can't you ship my new phone to Mexico? well, I hadn't paid for THAT coverage- out of country. I thought I was covered. So, I had to wait a week until I returned, but luckily I had use of my friend's phone for the next 4 days for taking pictures, and calling my taxi to get to the airport, etc. When I arrived in the US, I went straight to Verizon where I had arranged to have the new phone sent, and they helped me to set it all up. Thanks to using the i-cloud, I lost nothing! Just had to re-load my music. The co-pay was under $100, so reasonable. Moral of the story?  Check your plan closely/Get insurance to cover you international if you are trave/ing. Stay away from big waves. Get a phone case that holds the phone in securely. (I was left with the case, but the pone popped out- magnetic)."

I have gotten Asurion on most of my phones (12 years as Verizon customer) and this was the first time I used it on a broken phone.  It is good to have the peace of mind for coverage on the phones, but I have spent a lot on monthly payments as well as the deductible I paid towards this replacement phone.  So, I am not sure if I will continue using Asurion since I have only needed it one time in 12 years.  Asurion is great for those people who tend to break their phones."

"Replacement phones are terrible, go with Apple Care",CAITLIN W,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-31T23:46:10.000Z,,"My experience with Asurion has been terrible. My phone screen cracked and it had been a little glitchy anyway so I decided to use my insurance and get a replacement. I paid the deductible and got not one but two dud replacement devices that didn’t work. They definitely don’t send you a NEW phone, it appears to be refurbished. Finally I had enough and sent back both replacements and decided to keep my original and just fix the screen! I was told they would reimburse me for the deductible. I check back roughly a month later and guess who hadn’t received their refund? Contacted the company and they say it is coming now. Once I get me refund I will be cancelling my insurance and going with Apple Care. What is the point if the replacement devices are worse than the originals?"

Absolutely ridiculous,Nick Reno,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-28T22:21:17.000Z,,"Absolutely ridiculous! I cannot believe Verizon partners with these guys. So I submit a claim on my cracked Galaxy s8+ and the next day receive the replacement. The replacement that was sent was a regular s8 not a plus. So I call them. I had to call four times in a row as the menu was only giving me the option to track. Finally I reached a live person and was told that ""I selected the s8 instead of the +"". I was told to get my s8+ I would have to cancel the claim and file a new one and that my refund would take ONE TO TWO BILLING CYCLES. That's 2 months!!! And I would now have to pay a larger deductable. So I'll be out $400 for a replacement because THEY sent me the wrong phone and cannot refund me for 2 months? Seriously??? I am seriously considering cancelling Verizon now too. This is borderline fraudulent. Even if I did select the wrong device as they say I did, their menu was EXTREMELY difficult to use and select anything at all, that's saying a lot as I work in IT myself. They act like they do not know what device is on my account. It's as if I could select Iphone X to replace my Galaxy and they would not care. Absolutely horrible experience. I advise against using them unless you like getting screwed and double charged."

Asurion is worth every penny!,DALE  S,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-27T15:13:06.000Z,,"Asurion is worth every penny!  They are professional, easy to deal with, and repair or replace the damaged or lost items promptly. Whether it is a cracked iPhone screen, a non-functioning iPhone microphone, or a lost tablet, they have come through for us.  They have given us free upgrades and brand new replacement items where possible, and I especially like the fact that a tech comes to you to repair a cracked phone screen.  It is easy to file a claim, and there is great follow-through.  We will continue to insure all of our devices with Asurion."

I’ve tried to submit a claim for a month,Tora,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-08-22T20:46:40.000Z,,"I’ve tried to submit a claim for almost a month now. The credit card system was down online so I had to call in every time. The first two times I tried calling in, the card system was down over the phone also. When I finally spoke to someone the third time and my card payment was accepted, I learned that the only way to have my screen fixed was by having a service tech to come to my home. That is not comfortable for me as I don’t like random people coming to my home. My service date was then scheduled 5 days from the date of the call and in a two hour time frame which requires me to be home longer and take more time off. I am so aggravated with this process and will be canceling any insurance related to Asurion after this."

Cracked screen on Samsung 8+,Robert Jewellson,,US,1 review,2018-08-21T23:59:16.000Z,,Cracked screen on Samsung 8+. Set up to have repaired at my house tech called and said it would be faster if he picked it up and carried to the shop and fix screen. Tech came to my house picked up phone and said he 'll have it back in 24 hrs. Got home from work it's morning and had and email stating it will be tomorrow afternoon before he returns it so that's 3 days without phone. Very unacceptable when tech know that is my only phone. Got on Facebook with tech support and they just have me the run around and no help from them. They told me to call the tech told them I have no phone their tech has it. Than they asked for email address and they would contact me by email no word from them. Very poor service. Will be getting insurance with another company if I ever get my phone back.
45 days and no money,Matt Denson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-21T23:55:07.000Z,,"Our fridge broke and was reported to Asurion on July 5th. Today is August 21st. I have email confirmation that the refund check was to be delivered August 15th and I have called them 5 times today and they will not give me a tracking number.  A broken fridge in the middle of the summer for 45 days. I kid you not, I talked to at least 16 different supervisors and representatives throughout the 45 days.  I called them at least 50 times, and this is not an exaggeration.  Be ready to speak to a different person each time you call, with no resolution. Only one person was helpful in that bunch.  His name is Lyman.   If you want to wait for 45 days and waste 45 minutes each time you call, this is the company to work with.  Go ahead and purchase their services, but be warned, this is what you are getting.  Happy Shopping!"

At 11AM on a Friday I went to the Asurion website to file a claim. The website was remarkably clear and easy to navigate, with easy-to-read and understand text and big buttons to click. I am computer-savvy, but even so I appreciate the site (go and figure out some banking sites, or store sites).So at 11AM Friday I entered my claim; will ship in 1-2 business days. Good enough: that means Monday or Tuesday, right? In fact, at 11AM Saturday I was accepting a package from FedEx. 24 hours!As it happens, that replacement phone had a defect that took us a couple days to notice. No problem: I called, and an immediate response. Replacement on its way, and again about 24hrs later we had the phone.Excellent service, they discounted the deductible 50% due to no prior claims, and cheaper than buying a new phone we don't need. These days being without a phone is a full-blown crisis. Back it up, and get this insurance."

Absolutely would recommend to others..,MYRA P,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-08-12T22:48:31.000Z,,"Absolutely would recommend to others... this was first time I used insurance to fix any of my cell phones. The ONLY drawback was that I was unable to receive the exact duplicate of my Samsung Galaxy 7 Active (I LIKED having the physical buttons). Instead, I got an upgrade (which I am still getting things settled in and used to -- I know, waaah, waaah -- but as I said, I LIKED the physical buttons on the S7 Active)... I did have to purchase a different case, different screen 'glass protectors' which along with the co-pay of $112, kind of adds up...  BUT, I am thoroughly happy with the upgrade -- and I'll get used to the new features soon. I do like that the upgrade has a way to click for 'still' photo while recording a video!!! That's pretty handy! Thank you."

DO NOT BUY THIS INSURANCE,Tara,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-12T13:44:51.000Z,,"This was the worst company I have ever dealt with. I shattered my phone and went to verizon and set up a at home fix with them. After that, I was put through numerous ridiculous circumstances, first with the technician never showing up and never calling to let us know. I waited in my house for 8 hours in hopes they would come, and called asurion twice to only be told that they’re “sorry, the part is not available and they will send a new technician with the part”. The “new” technician never showed up, and then I was told that they don’t know when they would get my part (a seven plus screen) in- it could be within the week or more. It was absoutletly ridiculous. I PAY for this insurance to not have to worry if I break my phone. Instead, this company completely disregarded my concerns and left me with no idea on what to do with my phone. I ended up having to pay out of pocket to get it fixed somewhere else, since the crack couldn’t wait “more than a week” for the part to come in. The only good thing about Asurion is that they refunded me the rate of $30 that I had to initially pay to get my phone fixed. Besides that, it was the worst service I’ve ever dealt with from a company. DO NOT BY THIS INSURANCE. YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR PHONE FIXED."

It wasn’t with ease. When filing a claim trying to do from a mobile phone was difficult to navigate. Once my “Lost Phone/Stolen” claim was processed, they sent a new phone in a few days. I called to have them help set it up, but when they told me to insert a SIM card from my old phone (See Lost Claim Above) I ended up having to wait another 2 days for a Sim Card. Fortunately there was a nearby carrier store to buy immediately (additional $) a SIM Card as business was/is being conducted on my phone everyday. Attention to detail is critical, a simple phone sent with all required pieces to having it work out of the box would have netted 5 stars."

I was on hold for a long time, at one point someone didn't even let me finish what I was calling about and transferred me thinking they knew what I wanted.  (Hate when that happens). Once I got to the right person,  she gave me instructions to reset the phone. So I asked her ""how's that going to get rid of the thin white line in the middle of the screen? "". Her response: oh there's a white line on the screen? Well aren't you listening to what I'm saying? She then said we're sending you a new replacement phone out today. We got the phone the next day."

I consider this a scam company because…,Andrei Alfred,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,3 reviews,2018-08-08T22:53:31.000Z,,"I consider this a scam company because nothing of value is offered in exchange for the premiums.  My phone broke, and I was offered an inferior and older model.  This model could be purchased from the manufacturer via Amazon for $135 while the deductible with Asurion was $225.  In addition, they do not pay off the balance owed on your old phone, as auto insurance would; you still have to pay it off, and to add insult to injury, you also have to send the old phone in to Asurion.  I am guessing they refurbish these phones to provide to other claimants, thus bringing the scam full circle.  In sum: when compared to having no insurance at all, with Asurant I would pay an extra $90 for the replacement phone, no longer have my old phone for backup etc, and will never recover my wasted premiums."
Horrible website and customer service,"Scott R (Hey, it's Scott)",,US,1 review,2018-08-08T22:46:25.000Z,,"Website recommends to ship to an address other than your home and gives an option for suite, attn, etc. BUT FAILS TO ALLOW ME TO FILL THIS IN!!!! Then they demand a signed affidavit and photo ID BUT STILL FAILS TO ALLOW ME TO FILL THIS IN!!! What a joke. I need this phone replaced/repaired, I PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THIS INSURANCE, and I have to put up with this crap? This service/insurance is a complete rip-off. I'll be better off saving the money I spend on ""premiums"" and just getting the phone repaired somewhere that actually cares about customer service."

Initially I first got a hold of the…,KEITH R,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-08-06T13:29:31.000Z,,"Initially I first got a hold of the staff for my cell phone problems that I had on my Samsung S4. We were doing well on filing a claim for my first time. We ran into a problem when I couldn't find my IMEI number . The page that I was instructed to go to didn't have this on that page. I guess time was up for her as she gave me an 800 number or email address. I found that number by stumbling onto it and had hope she could bare with me or give a second instruction on where to find. So, I had gone thru another operator or agent of yours and found we could complete the claim but now the affidavit down load came into play in which I had to file it twice because what I didn't know is my husband was the primary name on the account. I wished that someone told me that in the first place because it would of saved time and frustration on my part. So, the new phone came and I turned the old one in back to you. The only problem that I had to that was my old phone turned off and on so much that neither the local AT&T person and myself could find a way for the phone to stay on long enough to transfer my personal info.so, the four star meant good but very frustrating with so much time on the house phone and my old phone clearance of personal information."

But thanks to a few I was able to get adequate assistance.  The process of making a claim needs to be updated.  To not have online portal or mobile app to verify ID by upload, phone pic upload documents, or use digital fillable docs with esign, but instead require a print, wet sign and a fax is ridiculously outdated and to me suggest a deliberate attempt to make the process more difficult than it should be.  Being on vacation I had no printer or easy access to faxing.  I needed a replacement during my vacation, ended up getting a replacement after my 1 week vacation, which is unacceptable."

That left us with no working phone until a replacement could be shipped in two days (because the next day was a holiday.)

That took some arguing and a conversation with a supervisor. It was a simple (to us) case of our daughter accidentally drooping her iPhone 8 and it stopped working. For some reason we were challenged on the validity of the claim - something to do with the fact we were still able to turn it on and off' even though it had no functionality. Once resolved, however' the return and replacement went flawlessly."

Kept sending me messages stating I had not completely shut down the old phone when I had Verizon did it for me. Since I needed my six digit code to complete the process and they sent it to my then totally dead phone I could not retrieve it. I spent several hours trying to complete this transaction with several trips to Verizon. When I was threatened with further charges if I didn't complete what I had already completed I realized that the people ( Asurion ) were not any better a taking care of business than I was. The process did get completed but with unnecessary stress and time. Not an easy process.

"Customer service great, device selection lacking",ASHLEY F,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-30T17:19:37.000Z,,"The customer service is great.  However, the options for the actual devices was disappointing.  My first claim was for a Galaxy S6 in gold.  The wifi stopped working altogether and after a repair attempt that was recommended by a Verizon rep, Verizon made good and set up the initial claim to have it replaced and gave me an upgrade to the S8.  This should have been exciting, but it was actually very, very disappointing to not be able to get my new phone in my preferred color.  I understand the model wasn't available, but I think attempts should be made to accommodate the customer's preferences when they are making a claim.  It turned out, also, that the newer model has a curved screen, which I did not like because it is SO MUCH MORE vulnerable to cracking.  Sure enough, I ordered my new case and had the phone for a week.  The day before the case arrived, the phone fell out of the car onto a driveway and cracked on every corner and hairline fractures appeared across the entire screen.  It became worse over the next few weeks, so I had to order another one; again, in black, not gold.  All in all, for the customer service, the actual representatives are helpful and friendly and the process is quick and easy.  It is the device options and selection I personally feel is lacking.  Still wish I could have my original phone in the color of my choice, but working!"

Strongly considering leaving.,CHRISTOPHER W,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-29T23:48:17.000Z,,"the first replacement phone they sent me in fact had been rooted and could possibly have compromised my personal information.  the representative I spoke to clearly didn't care and I don't think the company as a whole gives much of a damn.  I've been paying for insurance with Asurion now for something like three years I've never once used it. The one time I needed it, I was expected to pay a $200 deductible... On an $800 phone...  There needs to be a pool or a maximum amount that you pay in, and it needs to be capped off at some point.. Asurion has made a fortune off of me and I am strongly considering cancelling the membership because I don't feel that it's worth it.  I can understand due to the expensive cost of an automobile why automobile insurance is needed.But if this company is going to charge me $200 if I accidentally cracked my screen and need it repaired or replaced I may as well just buy another phone."

Before a few days prior to the one year mark of the replacement, I had an accident with my phone and I was advised that I will not be insurable for a year time frame."

Thank God for Asurion Insurance,BARBARA C,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-07-28T03:25:48.000Z,,"Thank God for Asurion Insurance!  Within the first couple of days after purchasing new phones, my husband's phone slipped out of his pocket as he was getting up from a lawn chair on the porch shattering the screen.  We were SO UPSET.  We were referred to Asurion and they took the information with a pleasant and understanding attitude, which surprised me. His replacement phone was shipped that day and it arrived two days later, to our relief. Thank you very much for your pleasant, and prompt attention to what would have been a disaster had we not had our phones protected by Asurion Insurance.Sincerely, Barbara C."

The staff helped me with getting the new phone set up while on vacation and were very helpful. My only complaint is there needs to be some sort of tool to extract the SIM card included in the box. It's very difficult to find something small enough fit into the hole for the SIM card.
Not unhappy,TED B,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-26T12:57:22.000Z,,"I had them enter the information online in the AT&T store.  I think the process could be a bit faster (as someone with a lot of tech savvy seemed to struggle some so I know it would have been worse for me), but overall I was satisfied with the experience.  I've been paying the insurance for 9 years every month and then had to pay a $112 deductible so overall I don't think the value was great but it saved me from having to buy a brand new phone so that was satisfying.  I think it would be ideal for the deductible to decrease over the years if you haven't used it."

We paid the deductible and received phone a day later. Just over a month later the phone started to act up. We contacted them again and they started due to being over a month we would have to pay again. We reluctantly paid a second time and waited for the phone. Week later no phone came.We contact them again and they stated that if was a shipping error and they would have to restart the order. After being put on hold several times, 10 min at a time they stated they needed our card to order. We were then transferred to supervisor because we were not paying again. They had already taken out the deductible already and never received a phone. After waiting again for 10 minutes just to get the supervisor, she ordered the handset. I have had decent service in the past but this last time was ridiculous. 45 minutes call just to get them to send a phone they already charged. Horrible customer service."

Given the unique circumstances to my…,CLARE R,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-25T02:07:04.000Z,,Given the unique circumstances to my technical issue I had with my phone. I was satisfied when my phone was finally replaced. But the process to get to customer solutions was not easy. After paying for and having an appointment with a technician that fixed one problem which was the glass over the screen but possibly created another where the phone was no longer able to charge. Being told to pay another 180$ for a replacement phone was not appropriate. When paying 12$/month for insurance on a phone for 2 years you end up paying 288$. I guess given the option to either pay 180$ to have a phone sent to me or not have a phone for possibly 5 business days to send my phone in to be fixed was not really fair. I cant think of any person who uses their phone for business could go 5 days without their phone. I can understand if someone makes multiple claims on the same phone needing more of a copay to replace but I've been with Verizon for 6 years.

I was on the phone for an hour between Asurion and AT&T.  Finally someone from AT&T said they just mashed numbers on the phone until they got a person.  First phone arrived broken but when I finally spoke to someone they made everything right and now I am happy.  Please do something about the voice prompts or make an option for customer service.

This company is HORRIBLE!!!,Pastor Doug,,US,4 reviews,2018-07-18T14:03:19.000Z,,"We are 3 weeks into them accepting my claim on my device and having me ship it to them. We are 4 business days from when they contacted me, that they wrongly accepted the device and it should not be covered and they would ship it back to me. However, I have received nothing from them as to when or how it would be shipped and have not notification that the return has even started. I’m in a holding pattern in getting it replaced until it is returned. Yet they are doing NOTHING to make this right. How is this an acceptable way to do business?"

My watch went missing, I tried making a claim online when I found out my watch wasn't covered, I called customer service to be told that watch has to have separate insurance through asurion from my other devices.  They were no help at all. Spe d 5 days going back and forth with verizon and asurion yo figure it out. This isn't the first time I've had a horrible experience with them either. They claim to have you a working device in as little as 24 hours. However everything is on back order. Never again. I would rather just pay out of pocket for a replacement device."

Becoming widowed gave Asurion a loophole to deny my claim.,Courtney Fullmer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-16T17:29:33.000Z,,"I paid insurance on my son's phone starting in September 2016. My husband, who was the primary account holder, passed away in January 2017. When my son broke his phone in June of 2018 Asurion would not let me submit the affidavit because I was not the primary account holder. At that time I was required to create a new account as the primary account holder. Then when I submitted the affidavit, they said the previous account no longer existed, kept the 20 months of insurance payments and charged me the full deductible. I asked for managers and supervisors.  I talked to 3 different people all the way up to a representative from CEO Tony Vetter's office. They refused to help. They pocketed the money from a widow and her two sons. I am outraged! I know it's not a lot of money, but it's a promise this company made that I paid into faithfully for two-and-a-half years. When I made the claim I was denied because I was widowed. The company showed no humanity, simply hid behind paperwork and policy. It is unfathomable!"

"Some good, some bad- just like jelly beans.",Scott Cherry,,US,2 reviews,2018-07-16T12:20:14.000Z,,"My feelings are a little mixed in regards to my experience with Asurion. My first impression was pretty negative when I called and was essentially forced to register my claim with an automated service. Some of the questions I would have liked to clarify with a person before answering. Also, I had to try twice because during the first time the service stopped recognizing my button presses. When I was finally allowed to speak to a live person, I had to answer random personal questions about myself in order to prove my identity which I actually found rather disquieting. There should have been sufficient information available without having to dig into my personal information or my past, especially since I am arranging for the repair/replacement of my mother’s phone. By the way, she probably would’ve given up on the automated service; not being technically savvy and dealing with that would’ve been too much for her. The representative was very civil, but possibly not as helpful since I had to discuss things more than once in effort to convey my thoughts. I was also dismayed that I would be facing a charge for replacement even though the problem with the phone was not my mother’s fault. I feel like I already paid by paying for the insurance plan. AT&T never said I would pay anything extra- not when I signed up and not when I had this problem. Furthermore, the Asurion representative never asked about repair; he just treated the situation automatically as if this was the only available option. I don’t know if it was or not, but I wonder if it could have been free under repair or cost less. I only want to have a usable phone til fall when Apple releases its new versions, which I did mention. If I am due for upgrading my phones, why would I spend a lot for something I won’t be keeping for much longer? The answer is: I wouldn’t. Also, I was asked if I wanted a free car charger or earbuds and I was sent the charger even though I had specified the earbuds- not that I really wanted either. Even though the service was civil and expedient, I can’t say that I was really satisfied. I already know Apple would have charged more for something out of warranty, but it is hardly a consolation."

Its amazing how they think that refunding my $19.00 deductible makes up for the fact that I paid over $400.00 in premiums!!! They sent me a broken, refurbished phone that wouldn't start and I couldn't even charge.  When I complained about It, Asurian expected me to pay an additional $19.00 deductible, when I refused they sent my claim to the Fraud Department!!!  I was paying for insurance on my phone to avoid being out of touch for weeks. Finally, I realized that Asurian is a SCAM COMPANY! It does NOT MAKE SENSE TO BUY INSURANCE FROM THESE SCAMMERS!  My experience shows they defraud people they think are too financially insecure to fight back!!!!!  ASURIAN IS THE WORST!!!!!"

Painless and easy claim process,Anonymous from Grass Valley,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-07-13T02:37:55.000Z,,"Submitting a claim was easy, delivery times were met, and the activation process for the new phone not too difficult. The technician who helped with the activation was clear in her instructions, easy to understand, and patient. The entire activation process took less than 30 minutes and that included time spent downloading a transfer app needed to complete activation. The instructions and packaging for returning my damaged phone were, again, easy to follow. Now for why only 4 stars and not 5. A few days after putting the phone in the mailbox, I entered the USPS tracking number to get status. The message I received that day, and subsequent days, said the label was created but no package had yet been received. I called to see if it had been received or how I would know when it was received. It took about 10 minutes before someone told me I would receive an email once it was received and it should take 5-7 business days (it was about 10). I didn't see any of this information when I was filing the claim nor in the return instructions. Overall, the process far exceeded my expectations."

No help, no customer service, no timeline or we'll call you when its available. Nope just keep checking your claim is open for 180 days.....after review was made right because of the social media team. If not for them may have never been resolved. Thank you!

Asurion seemed to do all they could to…,JANET W,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-09T17:36:50.000Z,,"Asurion seemed to do all they could to deny my claim. I was using a spare phone of my sister's and they couldn't seem  to understand that I was making a claim on my water damaged and dead phone. It took a conference call (or two - I can't remember anymore) with Verizon to try to get that straightened out. Then each time I thought I had it straightened out and resubmitted my claim, they denied it (3x total). They neglected to tell me that each re-submission required a new claim number. It took another conference call with Verizon to determine that. They finally approved the claim and sent the new phone. I used their set-up tech support to set it up and try to get my non-working iPhone off the Find My iPhone. However, since it was offline, the tech person could not figure out what I needed to do and had me put it on a setting that said when the phone was turned on all would be erased. I thought all was taken care of but no.... a few days later Asurion e-mailed me and said they would charge a $500.00 charge because I had not taken my phone off the 'find my iPhone' app. I called them and explained what had happened. They told me to call Apple to figure it out. Apple was able to help me erase the phone and I have not heard back from Asurion so I assume all is well. It was a LOT of time and aggravation!"

But had I not had that phone I would have been screwed. I think you should make it so we can do these claims at at n t where we purchased the insurance/ phone.  At Apple it’s instant and I don’t believe I will buy this insurance again. I went to Apple first to diagnose my phone and I could have walked away with a new phone for $50 more had I used their insurance. I won’t be buying this insurance again based on having to wait a few days. Also I think it’s ridiculous having to print and download paperwork to sign and send back. It’s not convenient. Should be DocuSign, easy to do."

I have had cell phones and insurance with this company for years I never had to use them except once in the past about 4 years ago. To replace a phone and then recently my daughter broke her phone and needed a complete replacement. And then a few days later my phone cracked so literally back to back phone issues this happened in June my daughters phone came right away mine on other had just needed a screen replaced it’s now July 8th and have had a weekly call for over 40- 60 mins each time trying to figure what the problem is. Today I was hung up on while on hold. I get the run around like people just want to pass My issue over, finally today a supervisor found the issue they, had me down as not having insurance which I do I have a family plan so they also had to call Verizon and confirm which Verizon confirmed I am insured. And after all this the lady says sorry we can’t just fix the screen the computer is not allowing her to they want me to get a new phone of course they do the deductible for crack screen is $29 and the phone replacement is $150. So I told after countless calls and them not fixing the issue this should not be happening it’s just BS that they already took the $29 from my checking account but could not do the repair so now my claim is open but who knows when I’ll have the issue fixed. Also they could have fixed the screen the other day but now they don’t know why but computer is not letting her put in a repair order.  So unprofessional I’m paying for a service !!!!!! But not getting anything in return"

Wish I could give NO stars!,Stephanie Moneyhun,,US,1 review,2018-07-08T00:08:19.000Z,,"I'm am extremely disappointed in this Company. I placed my claim on 07/06 selecting Saturday shippings, Promising me the next day delivery (07/07). Early saturday morning I checked my claim number online, saying I would receive it that day but it wasn't providing me a shipping number, I proceeded to call the customer service number and check on the status. The automated line said it had been shipped... at about 7pm I because flustered after waiting all day for the phone and called again. I now selected to speak to an agent. Once on the line with the agent, I was on hold for 45 minutes while she checked the status of my order; then returning to the line to tell me there was a system error and my device was never sent out. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was placed on hold again until the supervisor was ready, which was no use because she told me that all she could do was expedite the shipping to get here on monday! (HOW IS THAT EXPEDITED IF IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HERE TODAY?!...) She then said she could compensate me with a $25 visa gift card that would take about 4 weeks to get here. Completely ridiculous, its unfortunate this is the insurance my phone company uses, and i'm now forced to use it. (Not to mention I asked if the phone will be new or refurbished and she said ""either, or"". I pay $13 monthly and a $200 deductible to receive a possibly refurbished phone.)"

Poor Service Experience,Victoria Byrne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-03T23:25:54.000Z,,"Asurion handled my Wal-mart phone replacement. The device malfunctioned on a Tuesday. On Wednesday I shipped off my old device at 9 am. By noon my Wal-mart online claim status said my replacement had been shipped. As of Thursday the NEXT week I still had not received my device. I reached out through the chat option online (which took two attempts before someone answered) and was told my phone was on back-order, the replacement should be arriving at their site the next day, it would be shipped to me on Monday, and I would receive an email when it shipped. On Monday I had received no email, so I used the chat support again. I was told the device would be shipped Tuesday. Today is Tuesday, and I had not received an email yet, so I contacted support again. The agent, Karla (who had been my agent every time I contacted them) gave me a tracking number and told me my device had shipped. The UPS website says that the package associated with that number has not reached their facility yet, but the label has been printed. Tomorrow is a holiday, so I will likely have to wait until Thursday for the package to even reach the UPS facility. [Update, the UPS website now says the package is in their delivery network.] I also received an email from Wal-mart saying my package has shipped, but the tracking number was for the product I sent them, not the one they sent me. Luckily I still have the tracking number the agent gave me in the chat. All in all, I'm very disappointed in my experience with Asurion so far. I would have felt much better if I had been told sooner, and without having to reach out to customer service first, that my phone was on back-order. Additionally, the fact that I can only contact customer support through a chat function is very inconvenient. I hope I receive my phone soon, as I have been without one for two weeks now."

This is one of the worst…,Tom Edison,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,6 reviews,2018-07-03T19:03:54.000Z,,"This is one of the worst organizations I have ever done business with. They wasted over six months, closed my claim, and never even notified me that they had done so.They were provided with all the info they requested and did nothing with it. It was all in order - copy of original warranty, repair estimate, invoice - everything. Yet  they did nothing. Zero, zilch, nada.I have only filed one other claim with them - and it went as smooth as silk. I don't know what their problem is now, but whatever it is, they need to fix it. I don't know how so many people can rave about them."

If I could give less than one star I would,Christina,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-03T02:20:35.000Z,,"Filed an insurance claim because there was a problem with the battery on my phone but had to pay $150 for the replacement device because the screen is cracked as well. The phone they sent me is completely broken and did not work from the second I got it. I didn't even get to use it or activate it and they even admitted they were able to see that it wasn't activated on my account. The home button doesn't work, the phone itself is extremely and unusually slow, and the sim tray wouldn't come out. I brought it to Verizon and they couldn't even fix it or get the tray out and told me to go to an iPhone fix it store to see what was actually wrong with it. They told me that this company basically sends out refurbished phones but the problem with that is that most of the parts in my phone aren't even from apple. They said that this company sends out the lowest quality of iphones that may not work and Apple told me the same thing. The iPhone fix it place said they didn't want to rip me off and that its best that I request a new phone from Asurion because it was evident they sent me a device that doesn't even work and I wasn't at fault for anything. After being left on hold for 10+ minutes multiple times and being transferred to 6 different people who all told me that I had to file a NEW CLAIM AND PAY THEM ANOTHER $150 because the sim tray wouldn't come out and that it counts as ""physical damage""... that's BS ASURION IS NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF SCAMMERS... EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL.  I reached a man named Jeffery who was extremely rude. This man would not let me talk and screamed over me. Overall, by far the rudest, most unhelpful, scamming, unprofessional customer service I have ever dealt with in my life. Why pay for insurance when all they're going to do is send you a phone more broken than the one you needed replaced and then demand another $150 for them to actually do their job and send a working phone?"

If Asurion is going to have people working for them, the least they could do is know what they are doing. I also pay insurance for all my devices, my husbands' phone was very old before we actually had to file a claim on it. If it would not have gotten damaged he would have never asked for a new phone until it actually stopped functioning. Although the phone was not up to date I was still charged for a refurbished phone. Why do I pay insurance if I still have to pay a deductible an such an old phone? What is the whole point? It makes me very upset."

Here goes my honest experience,DAVID H,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-07-01T17:54:57.000Z,,Here goes my honest experience. I was given the run around when I personally tried to contact you. Asurion kept trying to sell me something by giving me at least 20 sale's pitches. Everytime I thought I was done here comes another add! Disappointing to say the least. Finally I hung up after 15 minutes of adds! I contacted my phone company and told them I was ripped off with the insurance they sold me. They contacted you and waited on the phone with me till I was able to talk to a real person. After that I was taken care of fairly and fast. Still don't think it was worth all the Hassel of the first phone call. That was the worst time I have ever had trying to get a person in coustomer service EVER!

Their chat and customer service is great!Thank you Aurion.

Customer service,Michele Holland,,US,1 review,2018-06-29T02:02:13.000Z,,"Customer service, warranty dept are not service oriented at all.  I had received my replacement phone, but it came in with a scratch on the back. When I go to get another replacement phone and it is just the cracked screen, then $30, but if they try to tell me that I SCRATCHED THE BACK and want 150, the I WILL RAISE HOLY HELL. I asked them for a screen shot of their comments in the data base to be assured that they noted the scratched back, but they tell me they are not capable of taking a screen shot even, much less sending me some documentation that the issue on this new phone was noted.   Then I spent several hours with their phone help only to have to go back to VZ to get activation, despite the activation message that stated to call Ashurion.  VZ finally got the issue cleared up.   Believe me, I would pay more for a better service approach.  The last CSR at Assyouron stated that the only way they could help me was to get back to default, which meant that all the contacts that had previously come in from the cloud were wiped out.  I have 7000, plus lots of text, so all that time getting that info was lost.  I asked the CSR that told me to set to default to stay on the line with me after she said I needed to wait for 30 minutes to see if the phone would set up.  She said she would not because she could not afford to be on the call that long.  Never mind how long I was without my business contacts, several hours.  The attitude was not customer centric, despite I do not know how many times they called me MIss Michele.  How irritating!  I gave them one star for having the obviously missed by QA phone arrive on time. That is when the party started."

I cant honestly write anything however once again if in fact this is a 3rd party agency aside from at and t and apple has found my phone or has made it possible to pay a totally way too expensive deductible of something like 250 dollars and even after the 150 dollar deduction I am still outraged at the fact that nobody that works for at and t and IOS or anyone that works in the Information Tech industry can simply find my phone. So now not only could anyone find the iPhone X that was stolen from me and I gave the name of Career Criminal that I know for a fact stole my phone and then gave it to his girlfriend to use. So I am wondering this whole time that since I gave them the fuel for a huge fire under that Crime syndicate that probably just needs an old fashion friendly chain gang to get his mind right about work and how trust is earned not taken. SO where the heck is the old phone I turned in for like the tune of 229.00 dollars is what I was told and well after many calls and many attempts to inquire

Processes Fraudulent Claims,Misty Oxborrow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-06-27T01:17:29.000Z,,"My daughter’s new phone was shut off. There was no reason for it, so she went into our carrier store. They found that someone had reported her phone stolen and filed a claim with asurion the morning prior and was delivered this morning. My daughter had her phone with her, and the employees in the store identified it as hers.  Clearly the claim filed was fraudulent and the new phone obviously wasn’t delivered to our address on file. Asurion didn’t bother to contact us regarding the claim, yet replaced it in less than 24 hours. When it was reported, they told us that they would shut off the fraudulent phone, but my daughter’s phone wouldn’t be turned back on for TEN days!!! Seriously? Asurion accepts a fraudulent claim, and the criminal got a brand new phone in the mail and turned on in 24 hours, but the victim has to wait TEN days to have her phone turned back on??!!! Wow. We’ve been loyal customers for more than 12 years. If I could give less than one star, I would. Avoid this “insurance company” at all costs."

I have an Samsung Galaxy S8+ which has the IP68 rating indicates that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is water resistant up to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) for 30 minutes. So just a fair warning to everyone after you pay the high deductible. You no longer have that feature my phone was splashed on, not submerged under water. The front camera lenses got foggy. I called and asurion and they refused to replace it after just a splash. So apparently they send half repaired phones to customers because it could not resist a water splash while the Samsung S8 can be under water for up to 30mins with ease. I would rather pay the full mspr of the phone next time then dealing with a company that takes your money and sends to a crap phone back."

Once a model is upgraded by a purchaser, then the reduced rate of deductions would be reinstated and then again increased, only on an upgraded model..."

Before I started having these problems, I was able to unlock the phone with my finger print when the screen was on or off. Now it's still intermittent with this feature. As much as I would like to send this phone back for one that works, I do not wish to go through the process of setting up my apps and transferring information again.

The tech never showed up or called. When I called their customer service, they said I had to reschedule, because they had no clue as to why the tech didn't show up or knew who the tech would be. Bad way to handle a business! Not only they offer a bogus service, but they can't tell you who is the tech they are sending to your house. What if some crazy person shows up at your door and instead of fixing your device, tries to harm you? They are playing with people lives... I would be afraid to use such service! You should be really careful too. Customer service refused to give you any information as to how and where you can file a formal complaint, how is that helpful? Instead, it makes the whole business questionable. Just my opinion."

Maybe the ‘mailed’-notification from UPS to Assurion would help customers not feel concerned that they are going to be charged for the previous phone.  Don’t you cover lost phones too?  What is done in those cases?Good thing I kept my UPS drop-off receipt and tracking number."

It was okay,Kelley,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-06-09T00:00:19.000Z,,"It was okay. I think it's kind of ridiculous that each individual account with this pays on average $13 per device per month & then if you ever have to submit a claim, you pay another pricey deductible to get back a refurbished phone. I mean my account alone has paid $234 to insurance in the last 6 months, then had to pay an $29 deductible to get a REFURBISHED phone. That adds up to $263 dollars for insurance & one refurbished phone. When I could have not paid for insurance for those 6 months & bought a NEW phone with the money I would have saved. It did arrive overnight...but like I said you could purchase a new phone for the price of one insurance claim. Seems a little backwards to me, maybe if you placed a claim every 3 months or something, but your still paying for a refurbished phone. Other than that, it was great. Thanks."

Asurion won't resolve damage to home from repair person,KayE,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,2 reviews,2018-06-06T14:16:51.000Z,,"Purchased Asurion protection plan to cover my washer. Washer has been malfunctioning for 4 months, they have repeatedly sent a ""repair"" person to ""fix"" the issues and still washer is broken. 9 days ago the ""repair"" person tore the drain pipe out of the wall during the service call - now we have a broken washer and a broken pipe and Asurion will not resolve either issue.

Because multiple agents had trouble understanding my screen shattered at 1130PM the phone did not die until the next day. So everytime i resubmitted i would get the message that they are sorry but the date submitted was not correct. One told me to just put the different date and sign the affidavit saying it was the next say. I explained no i would not sign that seeing as it wouls be a lie because thats not when it happened. So thank you agent for trying to make me lie on a legal document.  I finally went back into verizon and set 1.5hr while they stayed on phone with customer service.  One month for a replacement phone.

Don't waste your money,ROBERT R,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,US,1 review,2018-06-05T23:47:25.000Z,,Turned in a claim. Paid $89.95 deductible.  Asurion sent me a used phone put together from used parts. Could not get it to work properly. After 2 weeks of fighting with the replacement phone I took it to an Apple store and they informed me the battery failed their test and would not hold a charge.I Called Asurion to ask to return the phone and for them to refund my $89.95. After arguing with 2 people they refused. I was informed they would send me another replacement phone. I argued that they did not confirm that the first phone should not have been sent in the first place as it was a used junk phone not much better than the one I sent in for replacement. I opted out of another phone to avoid any further hassle with junk phones. I then called my provider and canceled my insurance. Not worth the money or hassle. Buyer beware!!!

"Talk about a scam ASURION ""Protection Plans""",Jamie Ferro,,US,3 reviews,2018-06-06T19:06:07.000Z,,"Talk about a scam! These guys are the reason Protection Plans have such a bad name.  They make you jump through hoop after hoop in hopes you will just become exhausted and give up.  Now day 28 since the covered refrigerator quit working.   5 scheduled repair visits with no results.  Next step?  Schedule a 6th repair visit.  No thanks!  They do not replace until THEY ""determine that we cannot service your product"".  But they told me there is no time limit or maximum number of visits they can use before making this determination.  A month without a refrigerator is way too long for me - but not for them.  Avoid Asurion protection plans (offered by Home Depot and elsewhere I presume).  They took $250 up front and provided nothing but hassle and aggravation.UPDATE:  Looks like they have PR robot response to online reviews. I believe it's nothing but window dressing.  But I did respond to the email provided and will update if they actually do anything. The 3 other contacts provided previously have provided no answers.  I will update this with a link for others who want to join in our action against Asurion and Home Depot."

Asurion cancels during the repair window... twice,Samantha Karlaina Rhoads,,US,1 review,2018-06-11T16:52:14.000Z,,"I took time off work to schedule a repair and in the middle of the 2 hour repair window they called me and said they didn’t have device parts for the repair. So they made me reschedule, which was upsetting because my bosses weren’t happy about me taking time off work in the first place. So I had to live with a broken phone for another week until they could come to repair it. Then the morning of the repair, in the middle of the repair window, I got a call saying the technician was late and that he wouldn’t arrive until the end of the window. So that means more time off work for me, due to a late repair. But then as I sat there, the repair window ended and no techician showed up at all. So now I’m at a loss for hundreds of dollars from work and STILL walking around with a broken phone. Asurion is ridiculously disrespectful of my time.Edit: I called to follow up and they weren't helpful. I ended up asking for a refund. I also asked about a refund on the insurance itself but they haven't written back to me. I doubt they'll do that even though their company has just cost me a lot of time and money and hasn't repaired anything."

At first I didn't get protection but as the price of phones increased I decided to get it. I have never had to use it - until now. I have a friend on the acct. The battery on her phone swelled up so much it broke the battery case to the outside. It still worked but was afraid it would blow up.With the protection I able to replace it. The  Verizon store people helped me with it. When I contacted Asurion you were so helpful and explained things so I didn't feel like it was my fault and I felt like you really cared. It was a very easy and positive experience. I have already told people about my positive experience. I hope this can help others realize that protection can save a lot of money and what a great experience I had with your company.
